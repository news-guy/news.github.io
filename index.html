    <h1>Does all intelligent life face a Great Filter?</h1>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>The Universe should be full of alien civilizations. Why can’t we find any?</p><p>“Where is everybody!?”</p><p>It was around 1950. UFO mania had recently ramped up across the world, with dozens of reported sightings of strange flying machines fueling rampant speculation regarding their origins.</p><p>The eminent physicist Enrico Fermi was visiting his colleagues at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico that summer, and the mealtime conversation turned to the subject of UFOs. Very quickly, the assembled physicists realized that if UFOs were alien machines, that meant it was possible to travel faster than the speed of light. Otherwise, those alien craft would have never made it here.</p><p>At first, Fermi boisterously participated in the conversation, offering his usual keen insights. But soon, he fell silent, withdrawing into his own ruminations. The conversation drifted to other subjects, but Fermi stayed quiet.</p><p>Sometime later, long after the group had largely forgotten about the issue of UFOs, Fermi sat up and blurted out: “But where is everybody!?”</p><p>Every scientist at that table immediately knew what he meant.</p><p>That central question—where is everybody?—is now known as the Fermi Paradox in his honor. And while he wasn't the first person to wonder about the nature of other intelligent civilizations, he was the first to give the idea a modern spin.</p><p>The paradox arises from a seemingly innocent line of rational thinking that leads to an incorrect conclusion. It goes like this. We’re not special. We live on just another rocky planet around a ho-hum star in an unspectacular arm of an average spiral galaxy. There’s nothing incredibly unique or exotic about our physical circumstances.</p><p>And here we are. Alive. Intelligent. (Almost) spacefaring.</p><p>Nature tends not to do things just once. If we’re here and on the cusp of exploding into space, and there are hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy, trillions of galaxies in the Universe, and billions of years to play around with, the Universe should be teeming with alien civilizations. We should see evidence for them everywhere we look, the same way we see any other common process played out again and again in the cosmos.</p><p>And yet we’ve got nothing. No artificial signals in our radio receivers. No mega-engineering projects reshaping other solar systems. No artifacts embedded in our planet or any others. As far as we can tell, we are alone. To the limits of our observations, we are the only living creatures, the only intelligent civilization, to inhabit the cosmos.</p><p>So what gives? Something must be wrong with the chain of reasoning. Even though every step sounds sane and reasonable, it leads to a conclusion that flies in the face of the evidence. Hence, a paradox.</p><p>Decades later, the economist Robin Hanson was mulling over Fermi’s paradox and came to an uncomfortable conclusion. Maybe we’re alone because essentially nobody ever makes it. Maybe there’s some unavoidable barrier between the origin of intelligent life and said life setting off to explore the galaxy.</p><p>The position of this Great Filter, as he named it, is critically important as we contemplate the future of humanity. If the Filter is behind us, in our past, then we are one of the few lucky ones to survive in an otherwise lonely universe. If it’s in front of us, in our future, then we likely do not have much time left as a species (at least, a spacefaring one).</p><p>The key point of the Great Filter argument is that Fermi’s Paradox is not really a paradox. Instead, there is a false assumption baked into the chain of reasoning. The assumption is that because life is probably common, intelligent, spacefaring life is also common. Take that assumption away and Fermi’s argument breaks down, resolving the paradox. But how do we square the claim that intelligent life is rare with the solid argument that there’s nothing special happening here on Earth?</p><p>It comes down to a game of numbers. Intelligent life doesn’t have to be outright impossible. In fact, it can’t be—we’re here, and we’ve already begun taking our first steps into space. It just has to be so deeply rare that we shouldn’t expect to see any evidence for it elsewhere, despite decades of searching. So the game is to start with the plausible assumption of abundant life, then find a way to whittle that down to as close to zero as we can get it.</p><p>Hanson pointed out that life requires many steps to reach spacefaring status—especially the kind of spacefaring status that would get you noticed by nascent astronomers across the Universe. First off, life needs a place to call home. As far as we know, that means a rocky world with lots of liquid water, a decent atmosphere, and a stable star.</p><p>Second, life has to… well, become alive. There’s some secret sauce that turns an odd collection of prebiotic compounds and molecules into self-reproducing structures that undergo Darwinian evolution.</p><p>Once established, life has to go through a series of steps where it increases in complexity. On the Earth, this progression likely started with simple reproductive molecules like RNA. Life then figured out how to encapsulate itself as single-celled microbes. It figured out sex and exploded into a variety of multicellular forms. Some billions of years later, some of that multicellular life figured out how to be reasonably smart and start using tools to manipulate and control its environment. In our case, the birds figured it out first, but then the primates took it to another level.</p><p>Those smart, tool-using creatures then conceived of machines to take them into the edge of space. The last step is for that space-faring species to really go for it, sending themselves or their robotic emissaries far and wide, colonizing every available corner of the galaxy, and if they are sufficiently motivated, the Universe. Or, if they’re not quite in the mood for galactic colonization, then at least making some other signs of their presence, like blasting out galaxy-wide radio transmissions, modifying every star they come across, or engaging in a fair bit of mega-engineering.</p><p>For the Great Filter to work, one or more of these steps must be incredibly hard. It could be just one step, a cataclysmic cliff that species have an impossible time getting around. Or it could be a series of Lesser Filters that, taken together, create a labyrinth of steps that species can’t escape. No matter what, though, getting to the galactic stage has to be hard. So hard that any wannabe starfarers get snuffed out in the cradle.</p><p>So where is the Filter? Is it early on, with the development of life itself? Is it somewhere in the middle, on the long march to intelligence? Is it at the end, when going from simple orbital jaunts leads to lengthy interstellar excursions?</p><p>Considering that our own species is right at the very edge, at the last stage before galactic explosion, the question of the Great Filter takes on an existential edge. Have we already gotten through it safely, or are we counting down to the ending of our species?</p><p>To decide on the location of the Great Filter (or collection of Lesser Filters), we don’t have a lot of evidence to go on. Just us, our evolutionary heritage, and our meager astronomical observations. But even those slim lines can give us some insights.</p><p>We know from observations that the basic ingredients of life are ridiculously common. The Universe is perfectly capable of producing oxygen, carbon, and water in great abundance and then combining them into basic biochemicals. And as we continue to expand our catalog of exoplanets, we’re beginning to learn that potentially life-bearing worlds are a dime a dozen. Heck, even our nearest neighbor star, Proxima Centauri, plays host to a small terrestrial world in its habitable zone.</p><p>So when it comes to the very first step on the list of potential roadblocks, we can probably cross that off the list. Homes for life, if not life itself, are very popular.</p><p>But what about the magic of abiogenesis? We only have one known example of this happening in the entire Universe, but there is something interesting about the timing. Life on Earth appeared pretty much as soon as it could, right after (astronomically speaking) the crust cooled and the oceans formed. So we can reasonably argue that once the conditions are right, life starts to do its thing.</p><p>The next series of steps, going from basic life that has just figured out how to reproduce to complex life that can launch itself into space, is a different story. Again, going from our one single example of life on Earth, we see that it took a really, really long time for that to happen.</p><p>In fact, humanity probably represents the Earth’s last shot. In just a few hundred million years, the Sun will grow too hot. Our oceans will boil, and we will turn into another Venus. So while life got started in Earth’s first chapter, intelligent life didn’t appear until its last.</p><p>So maybe that’s it. That’s the Great Filter: achieving intelligence. In that case, woohoo! We made it! Pop the champagne. We’re one of the extremely rare, lucky species that survived the Filter, and we have nothing but the stars in our future.</p><p>Or not. We really don’t know. We only have evidence for life on one planet. If we ever see signs of microbes in the dust of Mars or buried under the ice sheets of the outer moons, that might be a hopeful sign that we’ve made it through—that life is common but intelligence is not.</p><p>But the Great Filter may not be done with us yet. For the foreseeable future, humanity lives balanced on the edge of a knife. To go and spread among the stars, we must develop the technology to acquire, store, and harness vast amounts of energy. But that same technological need carries with it existential risk; the same harnessed energies that can propel our species to the stars can grind us into the dust.</p><p>Already, we are haunted by the specters of nuclear warfare and uncontrollable climate change. It might be that neither would kill us completely (hopefully), but they would definitely put a long-term damper on our space ambitions.</p><p>The more we expand and establish ourselves on other worlds, the safer we’ll be, simply because of the numbers. At some stage, we’ll reach a tipping point, where the long-term survival of our species is all but guaranteed. The loss of a planet would be a tragedy, but it wouldn't be the end of our entire civilization. The path to getting there, however, is a treacherous one we’ll have to tread carefully.</p><p>But “everybody is going to die” isn’t necessarily the end result of the Great Filter, even if it does lie in our future. We see no evidence for any intelligent civilizations in the Universe. But that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. One possible resolution to Fermi’s Paradox is that aliens really are out there, but they're invisible to us.</p><p>Maybe the Universe could be teeming with advanced aliens who just… prefer to stay home. Maybe our current phase of accelerated technological growth is just that: a phase. It doesn’t necessarily end with a galaxy-spanning civilization. Not every culture on Earth, either throughout history or even right now, values constant expansion, consumption, exploration, and innovation. Maybe we’ll touch the edge of space and decide that our home planet is just fine, thank you very much. In that case, we shouldn’t expect to see evidence for aliens, because stay-at-homers don’t really make themselves noticeable.</p><p>Maybe colonizing space is exceptionally difficult, far more difficult than we could possibly imagine. It seems that the speed of light really is the ultimate limit, and no bit of clever physics can ever get around it. Other stars are painfully far away, and the energies needed to travel to them in any meaningful way are beyond even our wildest reckoning. We could work to advance our technologies for thousands of years and still barely make our presence known in the wider galactic scene.</p><p>In fact, the filter might simply be detection. A super-advanced civilization could persist for millions of years and spread to a bubble a hundred light-years across… and we may not have the technology to find it.</p><p>There are, of course, arguments that we should still see evidence for aliens somewhere. All it takes is one hyper-expansionist species to litter the whole galaxy with their technological detritus. Ultimately, given the current lack of evidence in any direction, the resolution to Fermi’s Paradox, and our response to the argument of the Great Filter, is one of personal preference.</p><p>If you think humanity is headed on a dark path, then you’re probably inclined to believe that the Filter is in our (near) future. If you think we have a shot at redemption and harmony, then you might think the Filter is safely behind us. If you look up at the night sky and don’t want to be alone in the Universe, you likely believe there’s some other resolution to Fermi’s famous question.</p><p>But no matter what, as we continue to scan the silent heavens above us, we are forced to ask the same question again and again. Where is everybody?</p>

        <p>Let Ars help you find some needles in Steam's massive haystack of game trials.</p><p>If you head over tothe Steam Next Fest chartsright now, Valve will offer you a glimpse of the 2,228 games offering free downloadable demos as part of the event through Sunday, March 3. That is way too many games to effectively evaluate in such a short time, even with the massive resources of the Ars Orbiting HQ.</p><p>But we haven't let that stop us from trying. With the assistance of some early access provided by Valve and game publishers, we've spent the last few days playing dozens and dozens of the most promising Next Fest demos in an attempt to pull out some interesting-looking needles from Valve's massive haystack. Below are the results of that search—a varied list of 11 titles we think are worth investing some time (and zero dollars of money) into a demo download.</p><p>But this is just a starting point. Please use the comments below to share any other diamonds in the rough you think your fellow Ars readers need to know about.</p><p>Developer:Lumino GamesPlanned release date:April 2025Popular steam tags:FPS, Online Co-Op, Action Roguelike, RogueliteSteam page</p><p>Start with the roguelike, room-based shooting action ofReturnal. Move it to a first-person perspective and add in the double-jump-and-dash movement system of the new Doom games. Throw in aHalo Infinite-style grappling hook that can be used for traversal or combat. The result would come pretty close toAfterblast, a twitch-action shooter that shines from the jump in this fast-paced demo.</p><p>This is the kind of game where halting your movement for even a split second often means being instantly overwhelmed by enemies that swarm from all angles. Rather than being hard to handle, though, the game's zippy movement makes it feel relatively simple to jump and dash from ledge to ledge, avoiding bullet-hell style projectile patterns as you do.</p><p>The grappling hook is by far the most satisfying part of the demo, though. Beyond jumping out of the way of opposing fire, you can also use it to drag yourself over to stunned enemies, exploding them into piles of goo and collectible items. Bouncing from enemy to enemy in this way, with a few well-placed jumps and dashes in between, felt like being a kid bouncing on a trampoline.</p><p>TheAfterblastdemo provides a feel for the game's randomized item system, which gives access to automated drones, powerful grenades, and other superpowers that should make each run feel unique. We can't wait to see more.</p><p>-Kyle Orland</p><p>Developer:NopopoPlanned release date:"Coming soon"Popular steam tags:Card Battler, Roguelite, Card Game, PvESteam page</p><p>If you remember cult-classic Flash gameCastle Wars, you already know the basics ofCastle V Castle. You and your opponent take turns using a handful of cards to either build up your own castle or break down the castle on the other side until one castle has been reduced to rubble. You then improve your deck and do it all again.</p><p>Playing effectively means figuring out when to attack, when to defend, and when to use cards to bulk up the various resources needed to play future cards. Strong play requires thinking a few moves ahead, both to avoid being left with a hand of unplayable cards and to counter or reflect potential incoming attacks from your opponent (or deny them the resources they might need).</p><p>An extremely clean black and white interface and quick, amusing animations make this a very easy game to pick up and play. But it's the strategy of taking on short-term risks to get long-term rewards that will keep you coming back for round after round. And while the demo's extremely punishing daily challenges are good for some continued longevity, we're hoping the final game will add online multiplayer battles rather than just letting us beat down the AI over and over again.</p><p>-Kyle Orland</p><p>Developer:Eko SoftwarePlanned release date:March 6, 2025 (Early Access)Popular steam tags:Action, Hack and Slash, Adventure, RPG, LootSteam page</p><p>If you've grown tired ofDiablo IVbut are looking for another dark, mouse-based action RPG to scratch the same itch,Dragonkin: The Banishedshould be right up your alley. Just like inDiablo,the name of the game here is clicking to move and attack swarms of enemies in dark isometric dungeons, throwing in some magical attacks with the number keys on your keyboard as needed.</p><p>TheDragonkindemo leads you through a lot of extremely expository and overwrought cutscenes, broken up by short playable vignettes that introduce you to the main character classes: the heavy, the archer, the fire mage, etc. These introductory characters seem extremely overpowered for the early game, cutting through enemy grunts like butter while barely taking a scratch from underpowered opposition attacks. But it gives a good feel for the wide variety of available attacks available, from radiating lightning to a satisfying bull charge.</p><p>It's only after this introduction that you're thrown into a more standard challenge, clearing out a dungeon with a low-level character that needs all the help they can get. While the moment to moment gameplay will be familiar toDiabloheads, a few small touches like a handy dash-dodge maneuver make it all lean a bit more towards the "action" side of "action RPG."</p><p>If you're looking for pyrotechnic explosions, cinematic cut scenes, and plenty of things to click on, you could definitely do a lot worse.</p><p>-Kyle Orland</p><p>Developer:CinderCat GamesPlanned release date:2025Popular steam tags:Adventure, Funny, SingleplayerSteam page</p><p>First-person shooters are obviously all about the shooting—it's right there in the name, after all. But the most satisfying part of these games is often running right up to an enemy and pounding them with a suspiciously powerful close-range melee attack.</p><p>Glumtakes this satisfying melee bit and makes it the focus of the whole game. Instead of fists or a bludgeoning weapon, though, your main melee weapon inGlumis a steel-toed boot. You'll see that boot hovering menacingly and incongruously in front of you as you zip around vaguely medieval-themed rooms, charging back with a bent knee for perfectly timed strikes as soon as an enemy gets in your face.</p><p>TheGlumdemo already takes this "first-person booter" concept in some interesting directions, providing plenty of barrels and other heavy objects you can convert into single-use projectile weapons with a kick from the right angle. You can also kick off of walls and other angled surfaces to fly through the air in some surprisingly satisfying and floaty platforming, which is key to finding the many secrets hidden in the demo's tutorial-esque rooms.</p><p>But the most satisfying part is still kicking an enemy directly and watching the ragdoll corpse fly off a wall and back toward your boot, where you can send it flying into other encroaching foes. The light-hearted comedy action is especially welcome in an industry that sometimes seems full of first-person games that are too full of themselves.</p><p>-Kyle Orland</p><p>Developer:Game SwingPlanned release date:"To be announced"Popular steam tags:Action Roguelike, Multiplayer, Post-apocalypticSteam page</p><p>Seeing and hearing the pre-game logo screen for Ghost Ship Games immediately puts my brain intoDeep Rock Galacticmode: headset on, workday stress abandoned, beverage ready.Guntouchables,published by Ghost Ship and developed by Game Swing, could readily fit into that slot. It's a multiplayer-first overhead shooter in which you and up to three other sausage-y folks with tiny stick legs grab loot, kill baddies, and get the heck out of there. If it's been a moment since you and your squad have shot some things together, send them a message andlink the demo.</p><p>A horde of mutants have overrun the world, and you and your fellow redneck preppers are having their moment. You pick a weapon, like the precise but slow hunting rifle or pray-and-spray SMG, and a character, each with their own secondary weapons and skill trees. The game shows you a map with stuff to grab or destroy and the car you need to reach to escape. Then you're off, moving with WASD keys and aiming in a circle with a mouse. The demo wasn't ready for controller play yet, but I could see it coming in the future (along with another justification for the trackpads on the Steam Deck).</p><p>I cajoled a friend into playing, and we had a great time, both blasting and winning, but also explaining to each other just how dumb that last move was. The game could do more to help you quickly identify and distinguish among your teammates, as they're currently all green names and health bars. And an optional tutorial mission would go a long way to help explain weapon and item mechanics that we had to test out live. But it's a demo, and the core experience—shoot, run, grab, swarm coming, panic—already feels plenty strong. There's a goofy, lightly icky charm to the voice-overs and visuals, and the upgrade paths are pleasantly addictive. It's a ridiculous game with a ridiculous name, and I recommend it.</p><p>-Kevin Purdy</p><p>Developer:Fair Weather StudiosPlanned release date:Q1 2025Popular steam tags:4X, Turn-Based Strategy, Auto Battler, StrategySteam page</p><p>When you play an RPG or strategy game, do you spend hours just staring at the tech tree, trying to figure out the upgrade path that will maximize your power going forward? If so, you'll probably loveHyper Empire, a super-condensed 4X space simulation where a good 80 percent of the game is spent staring at a menu screen and deciding how best to spend your limited resources.</p><p>That's actually more interesting than it might initially sound. You need to spend money on a fleet of ships to defend your carrier from potential attack, of course. But spending too much on powerful ships means you can't invest in the outpost stations and tools that will bring in even more resources (and more powerful ships) later in the run. The balance between short-term risk and long-term reward seems well-tuned for those who like to agonize over every potential decision.</p><p>When battles inevitably happen, they play out as automated orgies of interstellar explosions that can be a joy to watch, especially once you hit a critical mass of defensive ships. And while random happenings can influence your resources between those battles, none of them have seemed too impactful in the demo so far.</p><p>The biggest problem withHyper Empiresright now is that the demo caps out at 30 turns, right when the "just one more turn" resource-building loop is starting to get good. We can't wait to continue to juggle a bunch of numbers like an intergalactic accountant in the full game.</p><p>-Kyle Orland</p><p>Developer:Pocketwatch GamesPlanned release date:2025Popular steam tags:Co-op, Heist, Indie, Arcade, Top-Down, LootSteam page</p><p>It's been well over a decadesince the firstMonacowowed uswith its ultra-stylish overhead "heist simulator" gameplay. This long-delayed sequel keeps the same basic find-the-Macguffin-and-escape gameplay, but now with vibrant 3D graphics and more complex, multi-floor building layouts.</p><p>As with the firstMonaco, this is a stealth game that doesn't absolutely require stealth. Sure, it's easier if you sneak by the guards and cameras without raising the alarm, using handy sightlines and quiet movements to avoid detection. But if you're found, the game quickly transitions into something of a 3D game ofPac-Man, where you have to outrun the guards and use hidden corridors or hidey-holes to outsmart them.</p><p>TheMonaco 2demo includes four classes of thieves, each with their own unique way of distracting or avoiding the guards. I especially liked the socialite, who uses a toy poodle to charm nearby guards into ignoring her, and the tech specialist, who can use a drone to interact with doors and items while he hides in relative safety.</p><p>The updated 3D viewpoint loses some of the simplistic charm of the original's overhead perspective. Still, this modernized version of the classic stealth game is incredibly easy to pick up and play, especially with a few friends in co-op mode.</p><p>-Kyle Orland</p><p>Developer:Shiny ShoePlanned release date:"Coming Soon"Popular steam tags:Strategy, Card Game, Roguelike, Demons, PvPSteam page</p><p>Monster Train 2is a lot moreMonster Train. Given that the original is in my top five of all-time Steam game hours, I'm happy about that. Just 30 minutes into testing it, I had to tell myself, "No,thisreally is the last round," and physically walk away to enforce it. Well, the last round, and then some upgrade shopping. OK, one more andthenno more.</p><p>Monster Train 2is, like the original, an amalgam of turn-based tactics androguelike deckbuilding, with a heaven-versus-hell backstory that is arch, goofy, and entirely skippable. Enemies enter your train on the bottom of three decks and fight their way upward, turn by turn. Your card deck has hellish monsters that you place across three levels of your train and spells that can damage, buff your monsters, and debuff their misguided angels. The music is high-energy melodic metal, the art pops off the screen, and the challenge is largely the same: balancing momentary threats against the need to prepare for future baddies.</p><p>Besides new monsters, cards, and clans, the sequel adds some new things, all of which might add up to be a bit too much to manage for some folks. Hero-type creatures can have abilities with cooldowns. New card types include equipment you can put on creatures and abilities you can apply to train floors. You can customize your train and upgrade its core pyre with abilities. This demo had me forgetting monster abilities and feeling overwhelmed with where to focus my upgrades. And yet I had a good time, and I'll probably learn a new approach to turn actions over time. Hell, after all, devours the indolent.</p><p>-Kevin Purdy</p><p>Developer:Studio FizbinPlanned release date:March 18, 2025Popular steam tags:Indie, Hack and Slash, Action Roguelike, CombatSteam page</p><p>The surface similarities betweenReignbreakerandHadesare hard to ignore. ButReignbreaker's flavor of isometric run-and-gun-and-bash gameplay sets itself apart instantly with an extremely compelling steampunk aesthetic, full of clanging metal sound effects and relentless robotic enemies. That extends to the art direction, with thick outlines making it easy to pick out the color-coded hazards from the dull blues and grays of the metal-and-stone backgrounds.</p><p>Reignbreakeralso stands out for some extremely chunky-feeling melee attacks and a javelin that can be used for powerful ranged projectiles or slammed down as a temporary turret. Tight controls make it a joy to dash between enemy projectiles as you wait for the opportune moment to go in for the kill. TheReignbreakerdemo also shows off a few of the powerful bosses that will require most players to acquire a few permanent power-ups before making it too deep into the game's randomized corridors.</p><p>This is one to keep an eye on asHades 2continues to barrel through Early Access toward its eventual final release</p><p>-Kyle Orland</p><p>Developer:Club SandwichPlanned release date:"Coming soon"Popular steam tags:Singleplayer, Roguelike, Tactical RPG, IsometricSteam page</p><p>Like any good game with the word "Tactics" in its title,Shuffle Tacticsis all about positioning. Move your units on a grid to maximize the damage they can inflict on enemies while minimizing the counterattacks that will inevitably come on their next turn. You know the drill.</p><p>ButShuffle Tacticsadds just a hint ofSlay the Spireinto the mix, limiting your actions to those drawn from a deck of cards that you can build and modify between battles. As the game goes on, that means you might not be sure what options will be available on your next turn, forcing some quick improvisation if you want to maximize your chances.</p><p>I'm already a big fan of the demo's satisfying sword-throwing mechanic, which lets you toss your melee weapon for a ranged attack and then call it back for more damage when it returns to your hand. I'm also enamored with the game's evocative pixel-art animations, which make every movement and attack a joy to watch.</p><p>My biggest problem is that the demo gets very difficult very quickly; I had quite a few runs fall apart incredibly early when faced with an unavoidable "Elite" matchup that I wasn't yet powerful enough to conquer. Hopefully. the developer can work out the balancing issues before launch because this mix of tactical strategy and card-based luck is a match made in heaven.</p><p>-Kyle Orland</p><p>Developer:Far SeasPlanned release date:"Coming soon"Popular steam tags:Exploration, Third Person, Cute, RelaxingSteam page</p><p>"Be the squirrel" is Far Seas' description of its upcoming game, and while that's a big promise,Squirreled Awayseems on track to deliver. You're notjusta squirrel, mind you, but a tool-crafting, home-building, achievement-unlocking squirrel, owing to the demands of the gaming format. But when moving around, you get to experience the manic, sticky-pawed, and often weightless nature of squirreldom. Why do squirrels run corkscrews around the perimeter of a tree instead of climbing straight up? Maybe because, like me, they're trying to keep up with their camera view on their right controller stick while moving with the left.</p><p>Squirreled Away'sdemogives you a taste of its core mechanics, like stashing away items in a cache for winter or building an axe out of a pebble and twig so you can break larger branches into sticks for a fellow squirrel. The look, feel, and sound of the experience are decidedly calm, with single-instrument melodies lilting in and out as you scamper about, gather resources, and unlock quests and areas. You have health and stamina bars, but the game is gentle if you run them out, sending you back to safety or reminding you to eat some food.</p><p>It feels like a more kineticAnimal Crossing, with friendly animals and low-stakes challenges. Except that at any time, you could bail on your tasks, scamper upward, and leap from one far-out branch to another, living out the daydreams of anybody who works next to a window overlooking a tree.</p><p>-Kevin Purdy</p>

    <h1>AMD Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT review: RDNA 4 fixes a lot of AMD’s problems</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Ars Technica</span>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>For $549 and $599, AMD comes close to knocking out Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070.</p><p>AMD is a company that knows a thing or two about capitalizing on a competitor's weaknesses. The company got through itsearly-2010s nadirpartially because its Ryzen CPUs struck just as Intel's current manufacturing woes began to set in, first withsomewhat-worse CPUs that were great value for the moneyand later with CPUs that werebetter than anything Intel could offer.</p><p>Nvidia's untrammeled dominance of the consumer graphics card market should also be an opportunity for AMD. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards have given buyers very little to get excited about, with an unreachably expensive high-end 5090 refresh and modest-at-best gains from 5080 and 5070-series cards that arealsopretty expensive by historical standards, when you can buy them at all. Tech YouTubers—both the people making the videos and the people leaving comments underneath them—have been almost uniformly unkind to the 50 series, hinting at consumer frustrations and pent-up demand for competitive products from other companies.</p><p>Enter AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. These are aimed right at the middle of the current GPU market at the intersection of high sales volume and decent profit margins. They promise good 1440p and entry-level 4K gaming performance and improved power efficiency compared to previous-generation cards, with fixes for long-time shortcomings (ray-tracing performance, video encoding, and upscaling quality) that should, in theory, make them more tempting for people looking to ditch Nvidia.</p><p>AMD's high-level performance promise for the RDNA 4 architecture revolves around big increases in performance per compute unit (CU). An RDNA 4 CU, AMD says, is nearly twice as fast in rasterized performance as RDNA 2 (that is, rendering without ray-tracing effects enabled) and nearly 2.5 times as fast as RDNA 2 in games with ray-tracing effects enabled. Performance for at least some machine learning workloads also goes way up—twice as fast as RDNA 3 and four times as fast as RDNA 2.</p><p>We'll see this in more detail when we start comparing performance, but AMD seems to have accomplished this goal. Despite having 64 or 56 compute units (for the 9070 XT and 9070, respectively), the cards' performance often competes with AMD's last-generation flagships, the RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT. Those cards came with 96 and 84 compute units, respectively. The 9070 cards are specced a lot more like last generation's RX 7800 XT—including the 16GB of GDDR6 on a 256-bit memory bus, as AMD still isn't using GDDR6X or GDDR7—but they're much faster than the 7800 XT was.</p><p>The 9070 series also uses a new 4 nm manufacturing process from TSMC, an upgrade from the 7000 series' 5 nm process (and the 6 nm process used for the separate memory controller dies in higher-end RX 7000-series models that used chiplets). AMD's GPUs are normally a bit less efficient than Nvidia's, but the architectural improvements and the new manufacturing process allow AMD to do some important catch-up.</p><p>Both of the 9070 models we tested were ASRock Steel Legend models, and the 9070 and 9070 XT had identical designs—we'll probably see a lot of this from AMD's partners since the GPU dies and the 16GB RAM allotments are the same for both models. Both use two 8-pin power connectors; AMD says partners are free to use the 12-pin power connector if they want, but given Nvidia's ongoing issues with it, most cards will likely stick with the reliable 8-pin connectors.</p><p>AMD doesn't appear to be making and selling reference designs for the 9070 series the way it did for some RX 7000 and 6000-series GPUs or the way Nvidia does with its Founders Edition cards. From what we've seen, 2 or 2.5-slot, triple-fan designs will be the norm, the way they are for most midrange GPUs these days.</p><p>We used the same GPU testbed for the Radeon RX 9070 series as we have for our GeForce RTX 50-series reviews.</p><p>An AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D ensures that our graphics cards will be CPU-limited as little as possible. An ample 1050 W power supply, 32GB of DDR5-6000, and an AMD X670E motherboard with the latest BIOS installed round out the hardware. On the software side, we use an up-to-date installation of Windows 11 24H2 and recent GPU drivers for older cards, ensuring that our tests reflect whatever optimizations Microsoft, AMD, Nvidia, and game developers have made since the last generation of GPUs launched.</p><p>We have numbers for all of Nvidia's RTX 50-series GPUs so far, plus most of the 40-series cards, most of AMD's RX 7000-series cards, and a handful of older GPUs from the RTX 30-series and RX 6000 series. We'll focus on comparing the 9070 XT and 9070 to other 1440p-to-4K graphics cards since those are the resolutions AMD is aiming at.</p><p>At $549 and $599, the 9070 series is priced to match Nvidia's $549 RTX 5070 and undercut the $749 RTX 5070 Ti. So we'll focus on comparing the 9070 series to those cards, plus the top tier of GPUs from the outgoing RX 7000-series.</p><p>Starting at the top with rasterized benchmarks with no ray-tracing effects, the 9070 XT does a good job of standing up to Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti, coming within a few frames per second of its performance in all the games we tested (and scoring very similarly in the 3DMark Time Spy Extreme benchmark).</p><p>Both cards are considerably faster than the RTX 5070—between 15 and 28 percent for the 9070 XT and between 5 and 13 percent for the regular 9070 (our 5070 scored weirdly low inHorizon Zero Dawn Remastered, so we'd treat those numbers as outliers for now). Both 9070 cards also stack up well next to the RX 7000 series here—the 9070 can usually just about match the performance of the 7900 XT, and the 9070 XT usually beats it by a little. Both cards thoroughly outrun the old RX 7900 GRE, which was AMD's $549 GPU offering just a year ago.</p><p>The 7900 XT does have 20GB of RAM instead of 16GB, which might help its performance in some edge cases. But 16GB is still perfectly generous for a 1440p-to-4K graphics card—the 5070 only offers 12GB, which could end up limiting its performance in some games as RAM requirements continue to rise.</p><p>Nvidia got a jump on AMD when it introduced hardware-accelerated ray-tracing in the RTX 20-series in 2018. And while these effects were only supported in a few games at the time, many modern games offer at least some kind of ray-traced lighting effects.</p><p>AMD caught up a little when it began shipping its own ray-tracing support in the RDNA2 architecture in late 2020, but the issue since then has always been that AMD cards have taken a larger performance hit than GeForce GPUs when these effects are turned on. RDNA3 promised improvements, but our tests still generally showed the same deficit as before.</p><p>So we're looking for two things with RDNA4's ray-tracing performance. First, we want the numbers to be higher than they were for comparably priced RX 7000-series GPUs, the same thing we look for in non-ray-traced (or rasterized) rendering performance. Second, we want the size of the performance hit to go down. To pick an example: the RX 7900 GRE could compete with Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti Super in games without ray tracing, but it was closer to a non-Super RTX 4070 in ray-traced games. It has helped keep AMD's cards from being across-the-board competitive with Nvidia's—is that any different now?</p><p>The picture our tests paint is mixed but tentatively positive. The 9070 series and RDNA4 post solid improvements in theCyberpunk 2077benchmarks, substantially closing the performance gap with Nvidia. In games where AMD's cards performed well enough before—here represented byReturnal—performance goes up, but roughly proportionately with rasterized performance. And both 9070 cards still punch below their weight inBlack Myth: Wukong, falling substantially behind the 5070 under the punishing Cinematic graphics preset.</p><p>So the benefits you see, as with any GPU update, will depend a bit on the game you're playing. There's also a possibility that game optimizations and driver updates made with RDNA4 in mind could boost performance further. We can't say that AMD has caught all the way up to Nvidia here—the 9070 and 9070 XT are both closer to the GeForce RTX 5070 than the 5070 Ti, despite keeping it closer to the 5070 Ti in rasterized tests—but thereisreal, measurable improvement here, which is what we were looking for.</p><p>The 9070 series' performance increases are particularly impressive when you look at the power-consumption numbers. The 9070 comes close to the 7900 XT's performance but uses 90 W less power under load. It beats the RTX 5070 most of the time but uses around 30 W less power.</p><p>The 9070 XT is a little less impressive on this front—AMD has set clock speeds pretty high, and this can increase power use disproportionately. The 9070 XT is usually 10 or 15 percent faster than the 9070 but uses 38 percent more power. The XT's power consumption is similar to the RTX 5070 Ti's (a GPU it often matches) and the 7900 XT's (a GPU it always beats), so it's nottooegregious, but it's not as standout as the 9070's.</p><p>AMD gives 9070 owners a couple of new toggles for power limits, though, which we'll talk about in the next section.</p><p>We don't normally dabble much with overclocking when we review CPUs or GPUs—we're happy to leave that to folks at other outlets. But when we review CPUs, we do usually test them with multiple power limits in place. Playing with power limits is easier (and occasionally safer) than actually overclocking, and it often comes with large gains to either performance (a chip that performs much better when given more power to work with) or efficiency (a chip that can run at nearly full speed without using as much power).</p><p>Initially, I experimented with the RX 9070's power limits by accident. AMD sent me one version of the 9070 but exchanged it because of a minor problem the OEM identified with some units early in the production run. I had, of course, already run most of our tests on it, but that's the way these things go sometimes.</p><p>The replacement RX 9070 card, an ASRock Steel Legend model, was performing significantly better in our tests, sometimes nearly closing the gap between the 9070 and the XT. It wasn't until I tested power consumption that I discovered the explanation—by default, it was using a 245 W power limit rather than the AMD-defined 220 W limit. Usually, these kinds of factory tweaks don't make much of a difference, but for the 9070, this power bump gave it a nice performance boost while still keeping it close to the 250 W power limit of the GeForce RTX 5070.</p><p>The 90-series cards we tested both add some power presets to AMD's Adrenalin app in the Performance tab under Tuning. These replace and/or complement some of the automated overclocking and undervolting buttons that exist here for older Radeon cards. Clicking Favor Efficiency or Favor Performance can ratchet the card's Total Board Power (TBP) up or down, limiting performance so that the card runs cooler and quieter or allowing the card to consume more power so it can run a bit faster.</p><p>For this particular ASRock 9070 card, the default TBP is set to 245 W. Selecting "Favor Efficiency" sets it to the default 220 W. You can double-check these values using an app likeHWInfo, which displays both the current TBP and the maximum TBP in its Sensors Status window. Clicking the Custom button in the Adrenalin software gives you access to a Power Tuning slider, which for our card allowed us to ratchet the TBP up by up to 10 percent or down by as much as 30 percent.</p><p>This is all the firsthand testing we did with the power limits of the 9070 series, though I would assume that adding a bit more power also adds more overclocking headroom (bumping up the power limits is common for GPU overclockers no matter who makes your card). AMD says that some of its partners will ship 9070 XT models set to a roughly 340 W power limit out of the box but acknowledges that "you start seeing diminishing returns as you approach the top of that [power efficiency] curve."</p><p>But it's worth noting that the driver has another automated set-it-and-forget-it power setting you can easily use to find your preferred balance of performance and power efficiency.</p><p>One of AMD's headlining improvements to the RX 90-series is the introduction of FSR 4, a new version of its FidelityFX Super Resolution upscaling algorithm. Like Nvidia's DLSS and Intel's XeSS, FSR 4 can take advantage of RDNA 4's machine learning processing power to do hardware-backed upscaling instead of taking a hardware-agnostic approach as the older FSR versions did. AMD says this will improve upscaling quality, but it also means FSR4 will only work on RDNA 4 GPUs.</p><p>The good news is that FSR 3.1 and FSR 4 are forward- and backward-compatible. Games that have already added FSR 3.1 support can automatically take advantage of FSR 4, and games that support FSR 4 on the 90-series can just run FSR 3.1 on older and non-AMD GPUs.</p><p>The only game in our current test suite to be compatible with FSR 4 isHorizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and we tested its performance using both FSR 3.1 and FSR 4. In general, we found that FSR 4 improved visual quality at the cost of just a few frames per second when run at the same settings—not unlike using Nvidia's recently released "transformer model" for DLSS upscaling.</p><p>Many games will let you choose which version of FSR you want to use. But for FSR 3.1 games that don't have a built-in FSR 4 option, there's a toggle in AMD's Adrenalin driver you can hit to switch to the better upscaling algorithm.</p><p>Even if they come with a performance hit, new upscaling algorithmscanstill improve performance by making the lower-resolution presets look better. We run all of our testing in "Quality" mode, which generally renders at two-thirds of native resolution and scales up. But if FSR 4 running in Balanced or Performance mode looks the same to your eyes as FSR 3.1 running in Quality mode, you can still end up with a net performance improvement in the end.</p><p>Just $50 separates the advertised price of the 9070 from that of the 9070 XT, something both Nvidia and AMD have done in the past that I find a bit annoying. If you have $549 to spend on a graphics card, you can almost certainly scrape together $599 for a graphics card. All else being equal, I'd tell most people trying to choose one of these to just spring for the 9070 XT.</p><p>That said, availability and retail pricing for these might be all over the place. If your choices are a regular RX 9070 or nothing, or an RX 9070 at $549 and an RX 9070 XT at any price higher than $599, I would just grab a 9070 and not sweat it too much. The two cards aren'tthatfar apart in performance, especially if you bump the 9070's TBP up a little bit, and games that are playable on one will be playable at similar settings on the other.</p><p>We've got plenty of objective data in here, so I don't mind saying that I came into this review kind ofwantingto like the 9070 and 9070 XT. Nvidia's 50-series cards have mostly upheld the status quo, and for the last couple of years, the status quo has been sustained high prices and very modest generational upgrades. And who doesn't like an underdog story?</p><p>I think our test results mostly justify my priors. The RX 9070 and 9070 XT are very competitive graphics cards, helped along by a particularly mediocre RTX 5070 refresh from Nvidia. In non-ray-traced games, both cards wipe the floor with the 5070 and come close to competing with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti. In games and synthetic benchmarks with ray-tracing effects on, both cards can usually match or slightly beat the similarly priced 5070, partially (if not entirely) addressing AMD's longstanding performance deficit here. Neither card comes close to the 5070 Ti in these games, but they're also not priced like a 5070 Ti.</p><p>Just as impressively, the Radeon cards compete with the GeForce cards while consuming similar amounts of power. At stock settings, the RX 9070 uses roughly the same amount of power under load as a 4070 Super but with better performance. The 9070 XT uses about as much power as a 5070 Ti, with similar performance before you turn ray-tracing on. Power efficiency was a small but consistent drawback for the RX 7000 series compared to GeForce cards, and the 9070 cards mostly erase that disadvantage. AMD is also less stingy with the RAM, giving you 16GB for the price Nvidia charges for 12GB.</p><p>Some of the old caveats still apply. Radeons take a bigger performance hit, proportionally, than GeForce cards. DLSS already looks pretty good and is widely supported, while FSR 3.1/FSR 4 adoption is still relatively low. Nvidia has a nearly monopolistic grip on the dedicated GPU market, which means many apps, AI workloads, and games support its GPUs best/first/exclusively. AMD is always playing catch-up to Nvidia in some respect, and Nvidia keeps progressing quickly enough that it feels like AMD never quite has the opportunity to close the gap.</p><p>AMD also doesn't have an answer for DLSS Multi-Frame Generation. The benefits of that technology are fairly narrow, and you already getmostof those benefits with single-frame generation. But it's still a thing thatNvidia does that AMDon't.</p><p>Overall, the RX 9070 cards are both awfully tempting competitors to the GeForce RTX 5070—and occasionally even the 5070 Ti. They're great at 1440p and decent at 4K. Sure, I'd like to see them priced another $50 or $100 cheaper to well and truly undercut the 5070 and bring 1440p-to-4K performance t0 a sub-$500 graphics card. It would be nice to see AMD undercut Nvidia's GPUs as ruthlessly as it undercut Intel's CPUs nearly a decade ago. But these RDNA4 GPUs have way fewer downsides than previous-generation cards, and they come at a moment of relative weakness for Nvidia. We'll see if the sales follow.</p>

        <p>Darkness fell over Mare Crisium, ending a daily dose of dazzling images from the Moon.</p><p>Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost science station accomplished a lot on the Moon in the last two weeks. Among other things, its instruments drilled into the Moon's surface, tested an extraterrestrial vacuum cleaner, and showed that future missions could use GPS navigation signals to navigate on the lunar surface.</p><p>These are all important achievements, gathering data that could shed light on the Moon's formation and evolution, demonstrating new ways of collecting samples on other planets, and revealing the remarkable reach of the US military's GPS satellite network.</p><p>But the pièce de résistance for Firefly's first Moon mission might be the daily dose of imagery that streamed down from the Blue Ghost spacecraft. A suite of cameras recorded the cloud of dust created as the lander's engine plume blew away the uppermost layer of lunar soil as ittouched down March 2in Mare Crisium, or the Sea of Crises. This location is in a flat basin situated on the upper right quadrant of the side of the Moon always facing the Earth.</p><p>Other images from Firefly's lander showed the craft shooting tethered electrodes out onto the lunar surface, like a baseball outfielder trying to throw out a runner at home plate. Firefly's cameras also showed the lander's drill as it began to probe several meters into the Moon's crust.</p><p>The first Blue Ghost mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program established in 2018 to partner with US companies for cargo transportation to the Moon. Firefly is one of 13 companies eligible to compete for CLPS missions, precursors to future astronaut landings on the Moon under NASA's Artemis program.</p><p>Now, Firefly finds itself at the top of the pack of firms seeking to gain a foothold at the Moon.</p><p>Blue Ghost landed just after sunrise at Mare Crisium, an event shown in the blow video captured with four cameras mounted on the lander to observe how its engine plume interacted with loose soil on the lunar surface. The information will be useful as NASA plans to land astronauts on the Moon in the coming years.</p><p></p><p>“Although the data is still preliminary, the 3,000-plus images we captured appear to contain exactly the type of information we were hoping for in order to better understand plume-surface interaction and learn how to accurately model the phenomenon based on the number, size, thrust and configuration of the engines,” said Rob Maddock, project manager for NASA's SCALPSS experiment.</p><p>One of the vehicle's payloads, named Lunar PlanetVac, extended from the bottom of the lander and released a blast of gas to blow fine-grained lunar soil into a collection chamber for sieving. Provided by a company named Honeybee Robotics, this device could be used as a cheaper alternative to other sample collection methods, such as robotic arms, on future planetary science missions.</p><p>After two weeks of pioneering work, the Blue Ghost lander fell into darkness Sunday when the Sun sank below the horizon, robbing it of solar power and plunging temperatures below minus 200° Fahrenheit (148°Celcius). The spacecraft's internal electronics likely won't survive the two-week-long lunar night.</p><p>A precoded message from Blue Ghost marked the moment Sunday afternoon, signaling a transition to "monument mode."</p><p>"Goodnight friends," Blue Ghost radioed Firefly's mission control center in Central Texas. "After exchanging our final bits of data, I will hold vigil in this spot in Mare Crisium to watch humanity's continued journey to the stars. Here, I will outlast your mightiest rivers, your tallest mountains, and perhaps even your species as we know it."</p><p>In a statement, Firefly said it met 100 percent of its mission objectives for the Blue Ghost mission. The lander operated a little more than five hours into the lunar night, and Firefly mission control received the final data from the mission at about 7:15 pm EDT (23:15 UTC) Sunday.</p><p>"After a flawless Moon landing, the Firefly team immediately moved into surface operations to ensure all 10 NASA payloads could capture as much science as possible during the lunar day," said Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. "We’re incredibly proud of the demonstrations Blue Ghost enabled from tracking GPS signals on the Moon for the first time to robotically drilling and collecting science deeper into the lunar surface than ever before"</p><p>Blue Ghost's legacy is now secure as the first fully successful commercial lunar lander. Its two-week mission was perhaps just as remarkable for what didn't happen as it was for what did. The spacecraft encountered no significant problems on its transit to the Moon, its final descent, or during surface operations.</p><p>One of the few surprises of the mission was that the lander got hotter a little sooner than engineers predicted. At lunar noon, when the Sun is highest in the sky, temperatures can soar to 250° F (121° C).</p><p>"We started noticing that the lander was getting hotter than we expected, and we couldn't really figure out why, because it was a little early for lunar noon," Ray Allensworth, Firefly's spacecraft program director, told Ars. "So we went back and started evaluating and realized that the crater that we landed next to was actually reflecting a really significant amount of heat. So we went back and we updated our thermal models, incorporated that crater into it, and it matched the environment we were seeing."</p><p>Early Friday morning, the Blue Ghost spacecraft captured the first high-definition views of a total solar eclipse from the Moon. At the same time that skywatchers on Earth were looking up to see the Moon turn an eerie blood red, Firefly's cameras were looking back at us as the Sun, Earth, and Moon moved into alignment and darkness fell at Mare Crisium.</p><p>The eclipse was a bonus for Firefly. It just happened to occur during the spacecraft's two-week mission at the Moon, the timing of which was dependent on numerous factors, ranging from the readiness of the Blue Ghost lander to weather conditions at its launch site in Florida.</p><p>"We weren't actually planning to have an eclipse until a few months prior to our launch, when we started evaluating and realizing that an eclipse was happening right before lunar sunset," Allensworth said. "So luckily, that gave us some time to work some procedures and basically set up what we wanted to take images of, what cameras we wanted to run."</p><p>The extra work paid off. Firefly released an image Friday showing a glint of sunlight reaching around the curvature of the Earth, some 250,000 miles (402,000 kilometers) away. This phenomenon is known as the "diamond ring" and is a subject of pursuit for manyeclipse chasers, who travel to far-flung locations for a few minutes of totality.</p><p>The Blue Ghost spacecraft, named for a species of firefly, took eclipse chasing to new heights. Not only did it see the Earth block the Sun from an unexplored location on the Moon, but the lander fell into shadow for 2 hours and 16 minutes, about 18 times longer than the longest possible total solar eclipse on the Earth.</p><p>The eclipse presented challenges for Firefly's engineers monitoring the mission from Texas. Temperatures at the spacecraft's airless landing site plummeted as darkness took hold, creating what Allensworth called a "pseudo lunar night."</p><p>"We were seeing those temperatures rapidly start dropping," Allensworth said Friday. "So it was kind of an interesting game of to play with the hardware to keep everything in its temperature bounds but also still powered on and capturing data."</p><p>Using navigation cameras and autonomous guidance algorithms, the spacecraft detected potential hazards at its original landing site and diverted to a safer location more than 230 feet (70 meters) away, according to Allensworth.</p><p>Finally happy with the terrain below, Blue Ghost's computer sent the command for landing, powered by eight thrusters pulsing in rapid succession to control the craft's descent rate. The landing was gentler than engineers anticipated, coming down at less than 2.2 mph (1 meter per second).</p><p>According to preliminary data, Blue Ghost settled in a location just outside of its 330-foot (100-meter) target landing ellipse, probably due to the last-minute divert maneuvers ordered by the vehicle's hazard avoidance system.</p><p>"It looks like we're slightly out of it, but it's really OK," Allensworth said. "NASA has told us, more than anything, that they want us to make sure we land softly... They seem comfortable where we're at."</p><p>Firefly originally intended to develop a spacecraft based on the design of Israel's Beresheet lander, which was the first private mission toattempt a landing on the Moon in 2019. The spacecraft crashed, and Firefly opted to go with a new design more responsive to NASA's requirements.</p><p>"Managing the center of gravity and the mass of the lander is most significant, and that informs a lot of how it physically takes shape," Allensworth said. "So we did want to keep certain things in mind about that, and that really is what led to the lander being wider, shorter, broader. We have these bigger foot pads on there.All of those things were very intentional to help make the lander as stable and predictable as possible."</p><p>These design choices must happen early in a spacecraft's development. Landing on the Moon comes with numerous complications, including an often-uneven surface and the lack of an atmosphere, rendering parachutes useless. A lander targeting the Moon must navigate itself to a safe landing site without input from the ground.</p><p>The Odysseus, or Nova-C, lander built by Intuitive Machines snapped one of its legs and fell over on its side after arriving on the Moon last year. The altimeter on Odysseus failed, causing it to come down with too much horizontal velocity. The lander returned some scientific data from the Moon and qualified as a partial success. The spacecraft couldn't recharge its batteries after landing on its side, and Odysseus shut down a few days after landing.</p><p>The second mission by Intuitive Machines reached the Moon on March 6, but itsuffered the same fate. After tipping over, the Athena lander succumbed to low power within hours, preventing it from accomplishing its science mission for NASA.</p><p>The landers designed by Intuitive Machines are tall and skinny, towering more than 14 feet (4.3 meters) tall with a width of about 5.2 feet (1.6 meters). The Blue Ghost vehicle is short and squatty in shape—about 6.6 feet tall and 11.5 feet wide (2-by-3.5 meters). Firefly's approach requires fewer landing legs than Intuitive Machines—four instead of six.</p><p>Steve Altemus, co-founder and CEO of Intuitive Machines, defended the design of his company's lander in a press briefing after the second lunar landing tip-over earlier this month. The Nova-C lander isn't too top-heavy for a safe landing because most of its cargo attaches to the bottom of the spacecraft, and for now, Altemus said Intuitive Machines is not considering a redesign.</p><p>Intuitive Machines stacked its two fuel and oxidizer tanks on top of each other, resulting in a taller vehicle. The Nova-C vehicle uses super-cold methane and liquid oxygen propellants, enabling a fast journey to the Moon over just a few days. The four propellant tanks on Blue Ghost are arranged in a diagonal configuration, with two containing hydrazine fuel and two holding an oxidizer called nitrogen tetroxide. Firefly's Blue Ghost took about six weeks to travel from launch until landing.</p><p>The design trade-off means Firefly's lander is heavier, with four tanks instead of two, according to Will Coogan, Blue Ghost's chief engineer at Firefly. By going with a stockier lander design, Firefly needed to install four tanks because the spacecraft's fuel and oxidizer have different densities. If Firefly went with just two tanks side-by-side, the spacecraft's center of mass would change continually as it burns propellant during the final descent to the Moon, creating an unnecessary problem for the lander's guidance, navigation, and control system to overcome.</p><p>"You want to avoid that," Coogan told Ars before Blue Ghost's launch. "What you can do is you can either get four tanks and have fuel and oxidizer at diagonal angles, and then you're always centered, or you can stay with two tanks, and you can stack them."</p><p>The four landing legs on the Blue Ghost vehicle have shock-absorbing feet, with bowl-shaped pads able to bend if the lander comes down on a rock or a slope.</p><p>"If we did come in a little bit faster, we needed the legs to be able to take that, so we tested the legs really significantly on the ground," Allensworth said. "We basically loaded them up on a makeshift weight bench at different angles and slammed it into the ground, slammed it into concrete, slammed it into regular simulant rocks, boulders, at different angles to really characterize what the legs could do.</p><p>"It's actually really funny, because one of the edge cases that we didn't test is if we came down very lightly, with almost no acceleration," she said. "And that was the case that the lander landed in. I was joking with our structural engineer that he wasted all his time."</p><p>Firefly delivered 10 NASA-sponsored science and technology demonstration experiments to the lunar surface, operating under contract with NASA's CLPS program. CLPS builds on the commercial, service-based business model of NASA's commercial cargo and crew program for transportation to the International Space Station.</p><p>NASA officials knew this approach was risky. The last landing on the Moon by a US spacecraft was the last Apollo mission in 1972, and most of the companies involved in CLPS are less than 20 years old, with little experience in deep space missions.</p><p>A Pittsburgh company named Astrobotic failed to reach the Moon on its first attempt in January 2024. The next month, Houston-based Intuitive Machines landed its Nova-C spacecraft on the lunar surface, but it tipped over after one of its legs snapped at the moment of touchdown.</p><p>Firefly, based in Cedar Park, Texas, was the third company to try a landing. Originally established as a rocket developer, Firefly signed up to be a CLPS provider and won a $101 million contract with NASA in 2021 to transport a government-funded science package to the Moon. NASA's instruments aboard the Blue Ghost lander cost about $44 million.</p><p>The successful landing of Firefly's Blue Ghost earlier this month buoyed NASA's expectations for CLPS. "Overall, it's been a fabulous, wonderful proof positive that the CLPS model does work," said Brad Bailey, assistant deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA's Science Mission Directorate.</p><p>NASA has seven more CLPS missions on contract. The next could launch as soon as August when Blue Origin plans to send its first Blue Moon lander to the Moon. NASA has booked two more Blue Ghost missions with Firefly and two more landing attempts with Intuitive Machines, plus one more flight by Astrobotic and one lander from Draper Laboratory.</p>

    <h1>Apple M4 MacBook Air review: I have no notes</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>The only things missing from these Airs are some Pro-only bells and whistles.</p><p>A year ago, we called the M3 version of the MacBook Air "just about as good as laptops get."</p><p>The "as good as laptops get" part was about the qualitative experience of using the laptop, which was (and is) good-enough-to-great at just about everything a general-purpose laptop needs to be able to do. The "just about" part was mainly about the cost because to be happy with it long-term, it was a good idea for just about everybody to spend an extra $200 upgrading it from 8GB to 16GB of RAM. Apple also kept the M2 version of the Air in the lineup to hit its $999 entry-level price point; the M3 cost $100 extra.</p><p>Apple fixed the RAM problem last fall when it increased the minimum amount of RAM across the entire Mac lineup from 8GB to 16GB without increasing prices. Though Apple probably did it to help enable additional Apple Intelligence features down the line, nearly anything you do with your Mac will eventually benefit from extra memory, whether you're trying to use Photoshop or Logic Pro or even if you're just opening more than a couple of dozen browser tabs at once.</p><p>The new M4 Air also starts with 16GB of RAM. And Apple is launching it at $999 ($1,199 for the 15-inch), ditching the M2 and M3 versions of the Air. It's hard not to be impressed with a laptop that addresses our two biggest substantive complaints about the previous version.</p><p>The laptop is still expensive, insofar as it is still a $1,000 laptop. But Apple is selling a laptop for $999 that would have cost you $1,399 a year ago. In a time of constantly rising prices, that's a pretty rare thing.</p><p>This is the third iteration of the MacBook Air's M2-era refresh. Apple originally introduced the design in the middle of 2022, and it was joined bya similar 15-inch iterationin the summer of 2023. For owners of Intel or M1 Airs or any other laptop, here's a brief recap: Apple got rid of the Air's tapered design for this one, in favor of a laptop that's still thin but has a uniform thickness throughout (0.44 inches for the 13-inch Air, 0.45 inches for the 15-inch model).</p><p>The laptop comes in four finishes—the traditional silver, the gold-ish Starlight, Midnight (still a bit smudge-prone), and a new Sky Blue option that replaces Space Gray. I like Sky Blue, and it's probably my favorite of the three light-colored options, though I do wish it was more saturated. It's similar in hue to the blue finish Microsoft offers for its Surface devices, but I prefer Microsoft's version because it's more noticeably blue.</p><p>The Air still takes a minimalist approach to ports, with a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports (both on the left side) and a headphone jack (on the right). You can free up one of those ports for other things if you use the laptop's resurrected MagSafe connector, but you can continue to charge it using USB-C power bricks or monitors. At this point in the USB-C transition, I've almost never used MagSafe outside of testing it and taking photos of its color-matched cable. But it's nice to have it back as an option.</p><p>The weirdest thing about it relative to those older pre-M2 Airs is still the display notch, a small cutout at the top of the screen that houses the camera. In practice, you mostly stop noticing it after a while. But the way macOS handles it makes the strips of screen space on either side mostly useless for anything other than the menu bar—most apps in full screen mode simply turn that part of the screen into non-functional black strips.</p><p>Speaking of the webcam, it's one of the few material changes from last year's model. It's now a 12 megapixel webcam, up from 1080p (about 2 megapixels). Like the webcam in the Studio Display, the M4 iMac, and the MacBook Pros, it has a wide field of view that it uses to support the motion-tracking Center Stage feature and Desk View mode, as well as preserve a bit more detail than the old webcam. You probably won't notice a difference when you're a tiny fraction of a window in a big Zoom call, though—white balance and color all look about the same, and you need to get close to see the difference in detail.</p><p>The M4 Air does two new things that might help talk you out of a MacBook Pro if you were thinking of buying one. For one, the maximum amount of RAM has increased from 24GB to 32GB. Second, the laptop can support up to two 6K external displays at 60 Hz without having to turn off the internal display. For both the M1 and M2 Airs, the limit was one external display. The M3 Air could support two external screens, but only if the lid was closed and the built-in screen was turned off. This finally gets the Air's external display count back up to where it was during the Intel era.</p><p>There are still features you'll need to buy a MacBook Pro to get, though. Those include the nano-texture display—a matte finish that Apple sells as an add-on for the iMac and MacBook Pros—and ProMotion, Apple's branding for screens that refresh at 120 times per second instead of 60. Given that it's available in the iMac, the absence of nano-texture is particularly annoying, though the Air's glassy screens still use Apple's anti-reflective coating. The 500 nits maximum brightness and DCI-P3 color gamut coverage are unchanged from previous models.</p><p>All the other fundamentals here remain solid, as they have been for years now. The scissor-switch keyboard has a comfortable amount of travel and will be a huge improvement for those who are still usingbutterfly-eraMac laptops. Trackpads are as large as they reasonably can be, but I haven't had problems with palm rejection. Neither laptop is setting records for thin-and-light-ness, but at 2.7 pounds and 3.3 pounds for the 13- and 15-inch models, they're light enough that your back and shoulders won't complain about having to schlep them around in a bag. And the silent fanless design remains a selling point—even the Arm laptops in Windows-land still mostly come with cooling fans.</p><p>Apple's M4 is a thoroughly known quantity by now thanks to the M4 MacBook Pro, the M4 iMac, the M4 Mac mini, and (to a lesser extent because of the software differences) the M4 iPad Pro.</p><p>The M4 added two extra efficiency cores to its CPU, bringing the total number of cores to 10 (four P-cores and six E-cores). The number of GPU cores is still 10, the same as the M2 and M3. The basic $999/$1,199 models have an 8-core GPU instead, so note that the performance in our graphics benchmarks below will be slightly lower on those models.</p><p>The big difference between this M4 and the one in all the other Macs is that the Air still doesn't include an active cooling fan. For Apple's chips, this usually means that they can run at full speeds for a few minutes under a sustained heavy CPU or GPU load, but that performance can slow down a bit once the chip gets too hot to run at full speed.</p><p>Note that Apple provided us with the 15-inch version of the Air to test and that the 13-inch version may throttle a bit more aggressively, depending on how well its heatsink dissipates heat.</p><p>The Air's M4 performs identically to the actively cooled versions in many of our lighter benchmarks, including Geekbench, single-threaded Cinebench tests, and even most of our graphics benchmarks. It's only in heavier, longer-running tests like our Handbrake video encoding tests that it begins to slow down significantly compared to the actively cooled versions of the chip. This is pretty consistent with what we've seen in the other Apple Silicon MacBook Airs; the kinds of workflows that will really challenge the Air are the ones that you don't really buy a MacBook Air to handle regularly.</p><p>Compared to older Macs, the M4's CPU is about 15 or 20 percent faster than the M3 in single-core benchmarks and 20 or 30 percent faster in multi-core benchmarks, thanks to its pair of extra CPU cores. The GPU's performance improvements are better in some tests than others, though somewhere in the 10-to-20-percent range is pretty typical. Apple is gradually working toward doubling the performance of the original M1, but we're not there quite yet—the M4 is somewhere between 50 and 70 percent faster than the M1 across the board, depending on what benchmark you're comparing. The M1 still feels good for most day-to-day computing, especially if you sprang for 16GB of RAM, but the M4 is noticeably snappier.</p><p>The M4 remains impressively efficient, using less energy than the M3 (and M1) to perform the same amount of work and consuming less power on average under load, something that should help its battery life. Apple still says that both Air sizes are good for "up to 18 hours" of battery life, the same broad estimate it used for the M3 and M2. In our days with the laptop, battery life felt about the same as it did for older Air models—the laptop can easily make it for a couple of full work days between charges, and for intermittent use, you can go days without plugging it in.</p><p>If I had a criticism, it's that there are a few nice-to-have features that Apple only offers on its Pro laptops. A display with a higher-than-60-Hz refresh rate and a nano-texture display option would both take the Air to the next level, even if they were both sold as separate add-ons. And the display notch still feels silly, given that the Mac never added Face ID and things other than the macOS menu bar can't really do anything with that top strip of screen space.</p><p>But other than pointing out things the Aircould alsohave, there's just not a lot to say here. For anyone other than people whoabsolutely need or requirean operating system that isn't macOS, this is the default laptop. And it's not even "this is the default laptop, but you should really pay at least $200 to upgrade the RAM if you want to be happy long-term." The vast majority of people can just navigate to Apple's site, pick the size they want, and buy the base models without needing to worry about it much. I have been writing about Apple's products for many years, and I am here to tell you how weird and rare that is.</p><p>If you aren't included in "the vast majority of people," Apple's upgrade prices are still Where They Get You. Want 24 or 32GB of RAM? 512GB or more of storage? Apple will charge you $200 for every 8GB of RAM you buy, between $200 and $800 for storage upgrades (you do at least get the M4's two missing GPU cores, a $100 standalone upgrade, for "free" when you buy more RAM). Like with the Mac mini, what feels like an uncharacteristically good value for the base model fades a bit for power users who need upgrades.</p><p>But again, for the vast majority of MacBook Air buyers, they won't need to worry about Apple's excessive upgrade pricing because they mostly won't need to worry about upgrading. It's a good value, hitting at a time when many people could be convinced to open their wallets for a new MacBook. For existing Mac users, maybe you're worried about the end of Intel Mac support, or you have an M1 Air that's starting to show its age. If you're a PC user, maybe the collection of minor annoyances that come with Windows 11 have you thinking about a switch. Whatever the reason, there's almost never been a better time to be considering a MacBook Air.</p>

    <h1>Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 review: No, it’s not “4090 performance at $549”</h1>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>It's not all bad news, but in many ways, this is barely an upgrade.</p><p>"4090 performance at $549."</p><p>That’s what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangsaidof the GeForce RTX 5070 when he announced the card at CES in January. Thanks to AI, this new midrange GPU would be able to match the frame rates of what had been the fastest consumer GPU that had previously existed for around one-third the price.</p><p>Let's dispel that notion up front. No, the GeForce RTX 5070 is not as fast as an RTX 4090, not without some very creative comparing of non-comparable numbers. Per usual for the 50-series, Nvidia is leaning on its AI-generated interpolated frames for the bulk of its claimed performance improvements. In terms of actual rendering speed, the 5070 isn’t even as fast as a 4080 or a 4070 Ti. It’s barely faster than last year’s 4070 Super, and it has disproportionately higher power usage.</p><p>For all that, it's still not necessarily abadcard—it's a little faster than the $599 4070 Super at the same $549 price that Nvidia used for the RTX 4070. It still represents Nvidia's minimum viable 4K GPU, once you factor in DLSS upscaling, and it’s well suited for people with 1440p monitors.</p><p>But it's a hard card to get excited about, and unlike every other 50-series GPU released so far, it actually has to compete against something—AMD's new Radeon RX 9070 series. I can't talk in detail about how these cards all stack up until later this week, but suffice it to say that Nvidia could use something a bit more impressive than the RTX 5070 at this price.</p><p>The 5070's CUDA core count falls right in between the RTX 4070 and the 4070 Super's, where the 5080 and 5070 Ti both included small increases from their previous-generation counterparts. To boost speeds over the 4070 Super, this means Nvidia is leaning on architectural improvements in Blackwell, the memory bandwidth increase from GDDR7 (a fairly significant 33 percent increase), and increased GPU clock speeds (the memory switch and clock speed boosts likely explain the higher power consumption).</p><p>The 5070 gives you 12GB of memory, which still clears that crucial “more than 8GB” bar you’ll want for higher-than-1080p resolutions and ultra-quality textures, though as time goes on, it may be more limiting at 4K if that’s a resolution you’re hoping to hit with this card.</p><p>The number that sticks out in a bad way is the power consumption—a maximum of 250 W under load, 30 W more than the old 4070 Super. The 5070 series is still far more power-efficient than older cards like the RTX 3070 or 3080, but efficiency is no longer as much of an advantage for the 5070 as it was for the 4070 series.</p><p>We reviewed the Founders Edition of the card provided by Nvidia, and it uses a different two-slot design than the much larger, much more powerful RTX 5090 and 5080 cards. It's the same physical size as the 4070 and 4060 Founders Edition cards, but with an updated power connector that's set at an angle instead of sticking out directly from the top of the card. Nvidia has updated the cooler design, too, moving both fans to the same side of the card rather than placing one on each side.</p><p>Whether it's because of the updated cooler or the higher power consumption or both, the 5070 actually runs hotter than any other card in our current round of testing, including (by a few degrees) the 5090. The card runs a bit loud under load—that's not a scientific measurement, but I noticed it more than I did when testing either the 5090 Founders Edition or the 4070-series Founders Editions. It's something to keep an eye on for any smaller or lower-end 5070 cards from partners that use smaller double-fan cooler designs, though we doubt it will be an issue for the triple-fan monstrosities.</p><p>Our testbed is the same as it's been since we updated it for the RTX 5090 review—a Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the heart of the build to minimize the likelihood that CPU performance will cap any of our GPUs' frame rates.</p><p>We've tested the 5070 at 4K and 1440p. Cards in this $500 to $600 price range tend to be a better fit for a 1440p high-refresh-rate gaming monitor, especially if you're hoping to play without DLSS or other upscaling technologies available.</p><p>But if you play older or lighter games, if you don't mind upscalers, and if you can turn down a few settings, hitting 60 frames per second at 4K is often within the realm of possibility. It's certainly the least I would spend if I was hoping to play on a 4K monitor.</p><p>The 5070 usually represents a mid-single-digit performance increase over the 4070 Super despite having fewer CUDA cores. It's about 20 percent faster than the RTX 4070—a comparison Nvidia would probably prefer, since the 5070 is technically replacing the 4070 at $549 and not the 4070 Super at $599. But the launch MSRPs for the 50-series have been mostly imaginary so far due to a combination of supply, demand, and people buying cards just so they can resell them for more money. We'd assume the same will hold true for the RTX 5070 until proven otherwise.</p><p>There were a couple of exceptions in our suite that performed strangely no matter how many times we re-tested them or how many times we tried clearing our shader cache or reinstalling drivers, and one game that benefitted from an outsized increase.Cyberpunk 2077in Ultra mode with ray-tracing disabled showed a larger improvement than the other games we tested—24 percent faster than the 4070 Super, and 72 percent faster than the 4070. It was an outlier, but some games may benefit more than others.</p><p>Horizon Zero Dawn RemasteredandCyberpunk 2077in Overdrive mode with DLSS turned off both gave abnormally low or otherwise strange numbers—we've presented those here for the sake of transparency, and we've communicated our findings to Nvidia, but we'd take these with a grain of salt when comparing results.Horizonseems to have some kind of issue with DLSS frame generation regardless of GPU, with low frame rates and odd visual artifacts across all the GeForce cards we've tested with recent drivers.</p><p>On the AMD side, we can't compare the 5070 directly to the RX 9070 series yet, but it's worth noting that the 5070 outperforms the old RX 7900 GRE by a small but consistent amount in our benchmarks without ray-tracing effects (the gap in ray-traced games is larger because of AMD's typical performance deficit in these games).</p><p>AMD says that the $549 RX 9070 and $599 9070 XT should be 21 percent and 42 percent faster (respectively) than the RX 7900 GRE on average. That could spell trouble for the 5070, but it remains to be seen whether AMD has fixed its ray-tracing performance problems and how much the cards' power efficiency has improved.</p><p>We ran our 1440p benchmarks on the GeForce RTX 3070, too, to give a bit more context for upgraders. The 5070 is usually between 40 and 70 percent faster than the 3070 here, a card that will find itself more and more limited by its 8GB of RAM as time goes on. The 5070 is still a good upgrade from the 3070; it's just not allthatmuch better of an upgrade than what you could get from a 4070 Super a year ago. As usual, the older your card is, the better the upgrade will feel, even if the generation-over-generation improvement is small.</p><p>In exchange for five or six percent better performance, the 5070 uses 13.5 percent more power under load than the 4070 Super did. Nvidia was so far ahead of AMD and the RTX 30-series on efficiency with the RTX 40-series GPUs that one relatively inefficient upgrade cycle doesn't really wreck things, but we do generally like to see power consumption either increase proportionally with performance or for performance to increase more than power consumption does.</p><p>Improving efficiency was always going to be tough for the 50-series, since the Blackwell GPU dies are manufactured using a 4nm TSMC process similar to what Nvidia used for the Ada Lovelace GPU dies for the 40-series. But the 5070 ends up slightly worse on this metric than the other 50-series cards.</p><p>When you turn frame generation on, you can see the source of Jensen Huang's "4090 performance for $549" performance claim. The 5070 with DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) enabled in 4x mode has a similar average frame rate inCyberpunk 2077compared to the RTX 4090 with the old Frame Generation mode enabled (now labeled "2x" in games that support MFG). That's because the 5070 is capable of generating three AI-interpolated frames for every rendered frame, rather than one.</p><p>But the 5070 (and, when they arrive, the 5060 series) demonstrates the limits of FG and MFG more than the other 50-series cards do. With MFG enabled,Cyberpunk 2077can hit over 80 frames per second on average with the Overdrive preset enabled. That sounds pretty good! Until you consider that the base frame rate (with DLSS upscaling enabled, but not any frame generation) is closer to 20 frames per second. With a base frame rate this low, user input will feel sluggish, and visual artifacts are plainly visible when objects are in motion.</p><p>DLSS MFG can still have its uses—the 5070 can push some pretty high frame rates at 1440p, and MFG could help you take better advantage of a 240 Hz or 360 Hz 1440p monitor than you could without MFG enabled. But it remains a relatively niche technology that's useful under certain circumstances, not the broad cure-all for mediocre performance that Nvidia's charts imply it is.</p><p>The GeForce RTX 4070 and 4070 Super were some of the best values in Nvidia's lineup last generation, offering the same performance as high-end 30-series cards and outstanding power efficiency for a little less money than you'd spend on an RTX 3080 or 3090.</p><p>Now that it's here, it's hard to classify the RTX 5070 as anything other than a disappointment. It's just barely, by the skin of its figurative teeth, faster than the 4070 Super for the same $549 MSRP as the regular 4070. This technically makes it an improvement, along with support for multi-frame generation. But this nearly imperceptible performance improvement comes with a 13.5 percent increase in power consumption under load, which seems like a bad trade-off any way you cut it.</p><p>The RTX 5070 feels like the kind of product you make when you're not particularly worried about what your competition is doing. Theentire50-series has sort of felt like that so far, between the astronomically high price of the RTX 5090 and the so-so performance improvements for the 5080 and 5070 Ti. But it's different for the RTX 5070 because AMD actually has an answer for it coming soon.</p><p>AMD's RX 7600, 7700, and 7800 GPUs may not have been smash-hit sales successes for its last generation, but stiffer competition at and under $600 did help pull Nvidia's pricing down to earth a bit. Soon we'll know whether the RX 9070 series will exert a similar pull—or if it can actually manage to wrest some market share back from Nvidia after years of trending in the wrong direction.</p>

    <h1>After 50 million miles, Waymos crash a lot less than human drivers</h1>

        <p>Waymo has been in dozens of crashes. Most were not Waymo's fault.</p><p>The first ever fatal crash involving a fully driverless vehicle occurred in San Francisco on January 19. The driverless vehicle belonged to Waymo, but the crash was not Waymo’s fault.</p><p>Here’s what happened: A Waymo with no driver or passengers stopped for a red light. Another car stopped behind the Waymo. Then, according to Waymo,a human-driven SUV rear-ended the other vehiclesat high speed, causing a six-car pileup that killed one person and injured five others. Someone’s dog also died in the crash.</p><p>Another major Waymo crash occurred in October in San Francisco. Once again, a driverless Waymo was stopped for a red light. According to Waymo, a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction crossed the double yellow line and crashed into an SUV that was stopped to the Waymo’s left. The force of the impact shoved the SUV into the Waymo. One person was seriously injured.</p><p>These two incidents produced worse injuries than any other Waymo crash in the last nine months. But in other respects, they were typical Waymo crashes. Most Waymo crashes involve a Waymo vehicle scrupulously following the rules while a human driver flouts them, speeding, running red lights, careening out of their lanes, and so forth.</p><p>Waymo’s service will only grow in the coming months and years. So Waymo will inevitably be involved in more crashes—including some crashes that cause serious injuries and even death.</p><p>But as this happens, it’s crucial to keep the denominator in mind. Since 2020, Waymo has reported roughly 60 crashes serious enough to trigger an airbag or cause an injury. But those crashes occurred over more than 50 million miles of driverless operations. If you randomly selected 50 million miles of human driving—that’s roughly 70 lifetimes behind the wheel—you would likely see far more serious crashes than Waymo has experienced to date.</p><p>Federal regulations require Waymo to report all significant crashes, whether or not the Waymo vehicle was at fault—indeed, whether or not the Waymo is even moving at the time of the crash. I’ve spent the last few days poring over Waymo’s crash reports from the last nine months. Let’s dig in.</p><p>Last September, IanalyzedWaymo crashes through June 2024. So this section will focus on crashes between July 2024 and February 2025. During that period, Waymo reported 38 crashes that were serious enough to either cause an (alleged) injury or an airbag deployment.</p><p>In my view, only one of these crashes was clearly Waymo’s fault. Waymo may have been responsible for three other crashes—there wasn’t enough information to say for certain. The remaining 34 crashes seemed to be mostly or entirely the fault of others:</p><p>There were two incidents where it seems like no crash happened at all:</p><p>So that’s a total of 34 crashes. I don’t want to make categorical statements about these crashes because in most cases, I only have Waymo’s side of the story. But it doesn’t seem like Waymo was at fault in any of them.</p><p>There was one crash where Waymo clearly seemed to be at fault: In December, a Waymo in Los Angeles ran into a plastic crate, pushing it into the path of a scooter in the next lane. The scooterist hit the crate and fell down. Waymo doesn’t know whether the person riding the scooter was injured.</p><p>I had trouble judging the final three crashes, all of which involved another vehicle making an unprotected left turn across a Waymo’s lane of travel. In two of these cases, Waymo says its vehicle slammed on the brakes but couldn’t stop in time to avoid a crash. In the third case, the other vehicle hit the Waymo from the side. Waymo’s summaries make it sound like the other car was at fault in all three cases, but I don’t feel like I have enough information to make a definite judgment.</p><p>Even if we assume all three of these crashes were Waymo’s fault, that would still mean that a large majority of the 38 serious crashes were not Waymo’s fault. And as we’ll see, Waymo vehicles are involved in many fewer serious crashes than human-driven vehicles.</p><p>Another way to evaluate the safety of Waymo vehicles is by comparing their per-mile crash rate to human drivers. Waymo has been regularly publishing data about this over the last couple of years. Its most recent release came last week, when Waymo updated itssafety data hubto cover crashes through the end of 2024.</p><p>Waymo knows exactly how many times its vehicles have crashed. What’s tricky is figuring out the appropriate human baseline, since human drivers don’t necessarily report every crash. Waymo has tried to address this by estimating human crash rates in its two biggest markets—Phoenix and San Francisco. Waymo’s analysis focused on the 44 million miles Waymo had driven in these cities through December, ignoring its smaller operations in Los Angeles and Austin.</p><p>Using human crash data, Waymo estimated that human drivers on the same roads would get into 78 crashes serious enough to trigger an airbag. By comparison, Waymo’s driverless vehicles only got into 13 airbag crashes. That represents an 83 percent reduction in airbag crashes relative to typical human drivers.</p><p>This is slightly worse than last September, when Waymo estimated an 84 percent reduction in airbag crashes over Waymo’s first 21 million miles.</p><p>Over the same 44 million miles, Waymo estimates that human drivers would get into 190 crashes serious enough to cause an injury. Instead, Waymo only got in 36 injury-causing crashes across San Francisco or Phoenix. That’s an 81 percent reduction in injury-causing crashes.</p><p>This is a significant improvement over last September, when Waymo estimated its cars had 73 percent fewer injury-causing crashes over its first 21 million driverless miles.</p><p>The above analysis counts all crashes, whether or not Waymo’s technology was at fault. Things look even better for Waymo if we focus on crashes where Waymo was determined to be responsible for a crash.</p><p>To assess this, Waymoco-authored a studyin December with the insurance giant Swiss Re. It focused on crashes that led to successful insurance claims against Waymo. This data seems particularly credible because third parties, not Waymo, decide when a crash is serious enough to file an insurance claim. And claims adjusters, not Waymo, decide whether to hold Waymo responsible for a crash.</p><p>But one downside is that it takes a few months for insurance claims to be filed. So the December report focused on crashes that occurred through July 2024.</p><p>Waymo had completed 25 million driverless miles by July 2024. And by the end of November 2024, Waymo had faced only two potentially successful claims for bodily injury. Both claims are pending, which means they could still be resolved in Waymo’s favor.</p><p>One of them was this crash that I described at the beginning of mySeptember articleabout Waymo’s safety record:</p><p>On a Friday evening last November, police chased a silver sedan across the San Francisco Bay Bridge. The fleeing vehicle entered San Francisco and went careening through the city’s crowded streets. At the intersection of 11th and Folsom streets, it sideswiped the fronts of two other vehicles, veered onto a sidewalk, and hit two pedestrians.</p><p>According to a local news story, both pedestrians were taken to the hospital, with one suffering major injuries. The driver of the silver sedan was injured, as was a passenger in one of the other vehicles. No one was injured in the third car, a driverless Waymo robotaxi.</p><p>It seems unlikely that an insurance adjuster will ultimately hold Waymo responsible for these injuries.</p><p>The other pending injury claim doesn’t seem like a slam dunk, either. In that case, another vehicle steered into a bike lane before crashing into a Waymo as it was making a left turn.</p><p>But let’s assume that both crashes are judged to be Waymo’s fault. That would still be a strong overall safety record.</p><p>Based on insurance industry records, Waymo and Swiss Re estimate that human drivers in San Francisco and Phoenix would generate about 26 successful bodily injury claims over 25 million miles of driving. So even if both of the pending claims against Waymo succeed, two injuries represent a more than 90 percent reduction in successful injury claims relative to typical human drivers.</p><p>The reduction in property damage claims is almost as dramatic. Waymo’s vehicles generated nine successful or pending property damage claims over its first 25 million miles. Waymo and Swiss Re estimate that human drivers in the same geographic areas would have generated 78 property damage claims. So Waymo generated 88 percent fewer property damage claims than typical human drivers.</p><p>Timothy B. Lee was on staff at Ars Technica from 2017 to 2021.

    <h1>The Moon’s next robotic visitor is lining up for landing this weekend</h1>

        <p>The first lunar lander built by Firefly Aerospace is on quite a trip, and has the selfies to prove it.</p><p>CEDAR PARK, Texas—Early Sunday morning, while most of America is sleeping, a couple dozen engineers in Central Texas will have their eyes glued to monitors watching data stream in from a quarter-million miles away.</p><p>These ground controllers at Firefly Aerospace hope that their robotic spacecraft, named Blue Ghost, will become the second commercial mission to complete a soft landing on the Moon, following thelanding of a spacecraft by Intuitive Machineslast year. This is the first lunar mission for Firefly Aerospace, a company established in 2014 to develop a small satellite launcher.</p><p>Since then, Firefly has undergone changes in ownership, a bankruptcy, and a renaming. Recognizing that the company had to diversify to survive, Firefly executives began pursuing other business opportunities—spacecraft manufacturing, lunar missions, and amedium-class rocket—to go alongside its small Alpha launch vehicle.</p><p>From a business perspective, Firefly's foray into lunar transportation has been worth the effort. NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program has awarded the company three contracts to deliver experiments to the Moon's surface. Under the first deal, NASA is paying Firefly about $101 million to transport 10 payloads to the Moon on the company's first Blue Ghost lander.</p><p>Now, Firefly is about to find out if its lunar program is a technical success. Landing on the Moon is risky. In the last decade, the success rate for lunar landing attempts is a little above 50 percent—6-for-11—and two of the successful landers either tipped over orlanded upside-down.</p><p>Jason Kim, Firefly's CEO, is confident that Blue Ghost will work. In an interview with Ars, Kim cited the lander's development team, design, and "robust" testing on the ground before Blue Ghost went to the launch pad as reasons for his optimism.</p><p>"At the end of the day, it's those three things," Kim said. "It's the people. Are you trained up? Are they committed? Are they responsible and own it? Two, it's the design with margin, really good designs with margin, then taking into account all the lessons learned (from other lunar missions).</p><p>"And then, three, the qualification program, testing it and testing it and testing it," Kim said. "That's what gives everyone confidence that we're going to stick this landing."</p><p>Assembled in Cedar Park, a suburb north of Austin, Texas, the Blue Ghost spacecraft is about the size of an SUV. Blue Ghost launched January 15 aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket alongside another privately developed lunar lander from the Japanese company ispace. The two landers are taking separate paths to the Moon, with Firefly due to land first, followed by ispace's Resilience lander at a separate location in the next few months.</p><p>You can find Blue Ghost's landing site on the upper right part of the full Moon in a dark region the size of Missouri known as Mare Crisium. This 340-mile-wide (550-kilometer) impact basin was formed when an asteroid struck the Moon nearly 4 billion years ago. Firefly will target landing near an ancient volcanic dome named Mons Latreille, which has sat dormant for billions of years after volcanic activity ceased on the Moon.</p><p>It will take 46 days for Blue Ghost to transit from the launch pad in Florida to Mare Crisium. The spacecraft spent nearly a month circling the Earth, gradually boosting its orbit higher until it reached the vicinity of the Moon on February 13, when it fired its engines to slip into lunar orbit. Since then, Blue Ghost has adjusted its trajectory several times before reaching a near-circular orbit about 60 miles (100 kilometers) above the Moon on Monday.</p><p>Firefly released a time-lapse video Monday from one of Blue Ghost's 12 cameras showing the spacecraft's top deck, with the Moon's cratered terrain unrolling beneath it. In the distance, a crescent Earth disappears behind the Moon's curved horizon, then reemerges in an Earthrise reminiscent of iconic imagery captured by astronauts during the Apollo program.</p><p></p><p>This week, Firefly is preparing for a final series of maneuvers this weekend to prepare for landing early Sunday. First, Blue Ghost will fire its engines for 19 seconds to drop its orbit closer to the Moon. About 11 minutes prior to touchdown, the spacecraft will ignite its engines again to decelerate from about 3,800 mph of lateral velocity to less than 100 mph (1.7 km/second to 40 m/second).</p><p>Blue Ghost will then pitch over to point its thrusters down toward the lunar surface and pulse a set of eight smaller reaction control system thrusters to slow its vertical descent. This phase of the landing sequence will begin with the spacecraft about 1,600 feet (500 meters) above the surface.</p><p>"Our RCS thrusters will continue to pulse as needed to control that descent to make sure that we are landing in a good orientation," said Farah Zuberi, Firefly's director of spacecraft mission management. "That reduces our descent rate to about 1 meter per second, and then our vision navigation system further tracks crater slopes (and) rocks to automatically select a hazard-free site within the landing zone that was identified by NASA.</p><p>"Then we will touch down onto the lunar surface," Zuberi said. "We’ll use our shock absorbing legs to stabilize the lander as it touches down, and then there are contact sensors on the footpads to signal engine shutdown, and that’s when we will know that we have nominally landed."</p><p>The lander's four shock-absorbing legs have some give, sort of like the crush zone of a car, according to Will Coogan, Firefly's chief engineer for the Blue Ghost lander. The legs have an aluminum honeycomb material inside, and they connect to bowl-shaped footpads with a ball-socket joint to give the spacecraft some flexibility in case it comes down on a slope or a rock. Ideally, the lander's navigation instruments will guide Blue Ghost to a flat landing site without any major obstacles.</p><p>"These footpads do bend," Coogan told Ars during a visit to see the Blue Ghost lander in its Texas factory. "They will bend a little bit around a rock, but they’ll also rotate to find the most stable position."</p><p>After landing, Firefly's ground controllers hope to switch from a low-bandwidth communications link to a higher data rate X-band system. If all goes according to plan, Blue Ghost could be streaming live video from the surface of the Moon back to Earth in as little as 30 minutes after touchdown.</p><p>Blue Ghost will operate for about 14 days (one entire lunar day) after landing. The instruments aboard Firefly's lander include a subsurface drill, an X-ray imager, and an experimental electrodynamic dust shield to test methods of repelling troublesome lunar dust from accumulating on sensitive spacecraft components. The spacecraft will drain its batteries after the Sun sets at Mare Crisium for the two-week-long lunar night.</p><p>A few of the NASA-funded experiments on Blue Ghost have already produced preliminary results. For example, an experimental receiver aboard the Blue Ghost lander acquired and tracked navigation signals from GPS satellites for the first time in lunar orbit, where these signals are 361 times weaker than on Earth. This is twice the distance of the previous record for the farthest GPS signal acquisition.</p><p>Future Moon missions, including human expeditions, will require precise positioning data to help spacecraft and astronauts navigate to pinpoint landings androve across the lunar surface. NASA's network of ground stations can provide navigation services for Moon missions, but their capacity is limited and oversubscribed by other spacecraft in deep space. Relying on existing satellite navigation signals would offload some of the demand for these ground stations and perhaps reduce the need for a dedicated fleet of navigation satellites in lunar orbit.</p><p>So far, the navigation experiment on Firefly's Blue Ghost shows this might be possible. In a few days, the receiver will try again to acquire GPS and Galileo navigation signals from the lunar surface, another first.</p><p>Engineers also gathered data on the performance of a radiation-tolerant flight computer as the spacecraft transited through the Van Allen radiation belts in the weeks following launch.</p><p>There's a reason Moon landings aren't easy. Landers like Firefly's Blue Ghost operate autonomously, ingesting cues from lasers or cameras to guide themselves toward a smooth landing. The Moon lacks an atmosphere to help spacecraft slow down during descent. More than 50 years elapsed between the last US landing on the Moon and the Intuitive Machines mission a year ago. One could argue lunar landing expertise atrophied in the United States.</p><p>Countless design decisions go into developing and building a spacecraft. Early on, Firefly's engineers had to determine what materials, engines, and electronics to use on Blue Ghost.</p><p>Most fundamentally, engineers needed to decide on the lander's shape. This matters. Firefly officials say their lander's design makes it less vulnerable to tipping over after a wonky landing. The Odysseus lander built by Intuitive Machines snapped one of its legs and fell over on its side after arriving on the Moon last year. The altimeter on Odysseus failed, causing it to come down with too much horizontal velocity.</p><p>The spacecraft continued operating and returned some scientific data from the Moon, so it qualified as at least a partial success. But the tumble prevented the spacecraft from recharging its batteries, and the Odysseus shut down a few days after landing. Asecond lander from Intuitive Machines, named Athena, launched to the Moon Wednesday and should reach the surface on March 6, just four days after Firefly gets there.</p><p>The landers designed by Intuitive Machines are tall and skinny. Firefly's Blue Ghost is "short and squatty" in shape, which should make it harder to tip over, said Kim, who took over as Firefly's chief executive last year.</p><p>Coogan said Blue Ghost's designers intentionally chose a shape for the spacecraft that puts the center of mass as low to the ground as possible. Intuitive Machines stacked their two fuel and oxidizer tanks on top of each other, resulting in a taller vehicle. The four propellant tanks on Blue Ghost are arranged in a diagonal configuration, with two containing hydrazine fuel and two holding an oxidizer called nitrogen tetroxide.</p><p>This trade-off means Firefly's lander is heavier, with four tanks instead of two. By going with a stockier lander design, Firefly needed to install four tanks because the spacecraft's fuel and oxidizer have different densities. If Firefly went with just two tanks side-by-side, the spacecraft's center of mass would change continually as it burns propellant during the final descent to the Moon, creating an unnecessary problem for the lander's guidance, navigation, and control system to overcome.</p><p>"You want to avoid that," Coogan said. "What you can do is you can either get four tanks and have fuel and oxidizer at diagonal angles, and then you're always centered, or you can stay with two tanks, and you can stack them."</p><p>Firefly's approach requires fewer landing legs than Intuitive Machines—four instead of six. And engineers designed Blue Ghost's landing legs to be more forgiving in uneven terrain or during an off-balance landing. "The lower your center of mass, is really the best," Coogan said. "There are only so many outcomes of this engineering trade."</p><p>NASA set up the CLPS program in 2018 to provide an avenue for companies to bid on opportunities to transport payloads to the Moon. While there are tangible scientific and engineering payoffs from the experiments aboard the CLPS landers, the initial salvo of commercial lunar missions has more sweeping goals. In this phase of the CLPS program, NASA wants contractors to show that they can reliably land on the Moon to foster a commercial lunar economy, facilitating a range of business pursuits to go along with the government's Artemis lunar program.</p><p>NASA has made 13 industrial teams eligible to compete for CLPS missions. The space agency has placed firm orders with five of these providers—Astrobotic, Blue Origin, Draper Laboratory, Firefly Aerospace, and Intuitive Machines—for 11 lunar missions. Intuitive Machines and Firefly have won the most CLPS task orders, with four and three missions, respectively.</p><p>Kim said he has talked with the other CLPS companies since becoming Firefly's CEO. They each are pursuing different technical solutions, but they face the same daunting challenges in getting to the Moon. While they compete for NASA's money, the CLPS competitors—or what Kim calls "competimates"—have a mutual interest in seeing one another succeed. A series of failures might cause NASA to restructure or cancel the CLPS program and wouldn't do anything to cultivate the lucrative business environment sought by all the CLPS companies.</p><p>"I've spoken to NASA Headquarters, and they give the same advice: 'Hey, go talk to the different CEOs of those different companies and learn from them and share with them as well,'" Kim said. "I've spoken to each of the CEOs. I've also done my own homework and research."</p><p>Thomas Zurbuchen, the former head of NASA's science mission directorate, was instrumental in getting the CLPS program up and running. Early in the program, Zurbuchen guessed the first group of CLPS lander missions might have a 50–50 chance of success. Borrowing from a sports metaphor, NASA officials likened CLPS to taking "shots on goal" with a regular cadence of missions, allowing contractors to try new ways of doing business, overcome potential failures, and try again in an iterative development cycle.</p><p>With the small sample size of two missions in the books, the CLPS program is batting .500, just as Zurbuchen predicted. The outcome of this weekend's landing attempt will determine whether CLPS moves ahead or behind the Zurbuchen curve.</p>

    <h1>Elon Musk recommends that the International Space Station be deorbited ASAP</h1>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>"There is very little incremental utility. Let’s go to Mars."</p><p>In a remarkable statement Thursday, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said the International Space Station should be deorbited "as soon as possible."</p><p>This comment from Musk will surely set off a landmine in the global space community, with broad implications. And it appears to be no idle comment from Musk who, at times, indulges in deliberately provocative posts on the social media network X that he owns.</p><p>However, that does not seem to be the case here.</p><p>"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let’s go to Mars,"Musk wrote at middayon Thursday.</p><p>This original statement was somewhat ambiguous. Last July, NASAawarded Space X an $843 million contractto modify a Dragon spacecraft to serve as a propulsive vehicle to safely guide the aging space station into the Pacific Ocean in 2030. So in some sense, preparations are already underway to shut down the laboratory.</p><p>I asked Musk if he meant that NASA and the US government should commit to the 2030 end-of-life date, or if he wanted to accelerate the timeline for the station's demise.</p><p>"The decision is up to the President, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now,"Musk replied.</p><p>In other words, the owner of SpaceX, the most powerful actor in spaceflight globally, and one of the most powerful people in the world who is presently working alongside the US president to transform the government, wants to bring the space station down in early 2027.</p><p>The politics of this are complicated. President Trump could propose shutting down the space station, but the budget for the deorbit vehicle (which is necessary, otherwise the station might make an uncontrolled reentry over land) must be funded by Congress.</p><p>The space station has key supporters in Congress, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), in whose state the orbiting laboratory is managed. Cruz has long been an advocate of the space station. Ars reached out to Cruz for a comment on Thursday, but the senator did not immediately respond.</p><p>However, a key source said Cruz was "furious" with the sentiment from Musk. The timing of Musk's tweet could make the confirmation of private astronaut Jared Isaacman to become NASA administrator more difficult. As part of the confirmation process, Isaacman is due to begin meetings with US senators in the coming week.</p><p>Having to answer questions about the end-of-life for the space station will make some of these meetings uncomfortable.</p><p>As chairman of the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation, Cruz effectively has control over Isaacman's confirmation process. He was also just re-elected to a six-year term, so theoretically Cruz is less susceptible to political pressure from the Trump White House.</p><p>Musk's statement would also put NASA in a difficult position. The US space agency, along with most of the international partners, wants to keep the space station operating until at least 2030. Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, has formally committed to operating the space station through at least 2028. The United States and Russia each operate a large segment of the space station, and cooperation from both major partners is necessary to keep the lab flying.</p><p>In reality, NASA has only been fully utilizing the space station since late 2020, when it began to fly a full complement of astronauts thanks to SpaceX's Crew Dragon coming online. The agency says it has a lot of worthwhile scientific and human performance research to conduct over the next five years.</p><p>NASA's selection of a deorbit vehicle last summer was a concrete signal that it intends to end the life of the venerable space station in 2030.</p><p>Some stakeholders, including Boeing, which has a large contract to operate the station for NASA, have suggested the facility could fly beyond 2030. However, structural elements of the station have been in space for more than a quarter of a century, andNASA is growing increasingly concernedabout leaks in Russian modules aboard the facility.</p><p>As the ISS goes away, NASA's plan is to transition operations to private space stations in low-Earth orbit, a plan it calls "Commercial LEO Destinations." The space agency has provided some funding to four different companies to begin work on these stations.</p><p>Nevertheless, this program is generally underfunded, and there are questions about the viability of private companies operating facilities in space by or before 2030. The general consensus in the space community is that if NASA wants to have even a single private space station operating in low-Earth orbit by 2030, it will need to increase funding for this.</p><p>There are some plausible explanations for why Musk would seek to end the life of the space station early. His statement about "Let's go to Mars" implies that the money presently being spent on the space station should be repurposed toward human exploration of Mars.</p><p>NASA's annual budget for the International Space Station is a little more than $3 billion. Of this more than half is spent on "transportation," which is cargo and crew supply missions. In 2023, for example, NASA spent $1.76 billion on transportation to the station, the majority of which went to SpaceX for its Dragon cargo and crew flights.</p><p>Canceling NASA's operations in low-Earth orbit could free up some funding for Mars if Cruz and the other ISS supporters in Congress agree, which seems questionable.</p><p>Musk has likely told Trump that NASA does not need to fund private space stations in low-Earth orbit. Rather, Musk could offer an alternative solution if NASA wants to maintain a presence there. SpaceX already plans to launch multiple Starship vehicles into space, and NASA is working on Starship life support systems for its Artemis missions. A version of Starship could be developed to provide a semi-permanent presence in low-Earth orbit.</p><p>This is, of course, easier said than done.</p><p>It would also wreck the business plans of multiple US companies working to provide this capability for NASA. Moreover, it would shoulder even more responsibility for the US space enterprise onto a single company, SpaceX. This goes against NASA's long-standing policy to have multiple providers and its desire to foster a healthy ecosystem of commercial space companies.</p>

    <h1>Space Force wants six kinds of space weapons—including anti-satellite lasers</h1>

        <p>Controlling space means "employing kinetic and non-kinetic means to affect adversary capabilities."</p><p>DENVER—The US Space Force lacks the full range of space weapons China and Russia are adding to their arsenals, and military leaders say it's time to close the gap.</p><p>Gen. Chance Saltzman, the Space Force's chief of space operations, told reporters at the Air & Space Forces Association Warfare Symposium last week that he wants more options to present to national leaders if an adversary threatens the US fleet of national security satellites used for surveillance, communication, navigation, missile warning, and perhaps soon, missile defense.</p><p>In prepared remarks, Saltzman outlined in new detail why the Space Force should be able to go on the offense in an era of orbital warfare. Later, in a roundtable meeting with reporters, he briefly touched on the how.</p><p>The Space Force's top general has discussed the concept of "space superiority" before. This is analogous to air superiority—think of how US and allied air forces dominated the skies in wartime over the last 30 years in places like Iraq, the Balkans, and Afghanistan.</p><p>In order to achieve space superiority, US forces must first control the space domain by "employing kinetic and non-kinetic means to affect adversary capabilities through disruption, degradation, and even destruction, if necessary," Saltzman said.</p><p>Kinetic? Imagine a missile or some other projectile smashing into an enemy satellite. Non-kinetic? This category involves jamming, cyberattacks, and directed-energy weapons, like lasers or microwave signals, that could disable spacecraft in orbit.</p><p>"It includes things like orbital warfare and electromagnetic warfare," Saltzman said. These capabilities could be used offensively or defensively. In December,Ars reportedon the military's growing willingness to talk publicly about offensive space weapons, something US officials long considered taboo for fear of sparking a cosmic arms race.</p><p>Officials took this a step further at the warfare symposium in Colorado. Saltzman said China and Russia, which military leaders consider America's foremost strategic competitors, are moving ahead of the United States with technologies and techniques to attack satellites in orbit.</p><p>For the first time in more than a century, warfare is entering a new physical realm. By one popular measure, the era of air warfarebegan in 1911, when an Italian pilot threw bombs out of his airplane over Libya during the Italo-Turkish War. Some historians might trace airborne warfare to earlier conflicts, when reconnaissance balloons offered eagle-eyed views of battlefields and troop movements. Land and sea combat began in ancient times.</p><p>"None of us were alive when the other domains started being contested," Saltzman said. "It was just natural. It was just a part of the way things work."</p><p>Five years since it became a new military service, the Space Force is in an early stage of defining what orbital warfare actually means. First, military leaders stopped considering space as a benign environment, where threats from the harsh environment of space reign supreme.</p><p>"That shift from benign environment to a war-fighting domain, that was pretty abrupt," Saltzman said. "We had to mature language. We had to understand what was the right way to talk about that progression. So as a Space Force dedicated to it, we've been progressing our vocabulary. We've been saying, 'This is what we want to focus on.'"</p><p>"We realized, you know what, defending is one thing, but look at this architecture (from China). They're going to hold our forces at risk. Who's responsible for that? And clearly the answer is the Space Force," Saltzman said. "We say, 'OK, we've got to start to solve for that problem.'"</p><p>"Well, how do militaries talk about that? We talk about conducting operations, and that includes offense and defense," he continued. "So it's more of a maturation of the role and the responsibilities that a new service has, just developing the vocabulary, developing the doctrine, operational concepts, and now the equipment and the training. It’s just part of the process."</p><p>Of course, this will all cost money. Congress approved a $29 billion budget for the Space Force in 2024, about $4 billion more than NASA received but just 3.5 percent of the Pentagon's overall budget. Frank Kendall, secretary of the Air Force under President Biden, said last year that the Space Force's budget is "going to need to double or triple over time" to fund everything the military needs to do in space.</p><p>Saltzman said the Space Force categorizes adversarial space weapons in six categories—three that are space-based and three that are ground-based.</p><p>"You have directed-energy, like lasers, you have RF (radio frequency) jamming capabilities, and you have kinetic, something that you’re trying to destroy physically," Saltzman said. These three types of weapons could be positioned on the ground or in space, getting to Saltzman's list of six categories.</p><p>"We're seeing in our adversary developmental capabilities, they're pursuing all of those," Saltzman said. "We're not pursuing all of those yet."</p><p>But Saltzman argued that maybe the United States should. "There are good reasons to have all those categories," he said. Targeting an enemy satellite in low-Earth orbit, just a few hundred miles above the planet, requires a different set of weapons than a satellite parked more than 22,000 miles up—roughly 36,000 kilometers—in geosynchronous orbit.</p><p>China is at the pinnacle of the US military's threat pyramid, followed by Russia and less sophisticated regional powers like North Korea and Iran.</p><p>"Really, what's most concerning... is the mix of weapons," Saltzman said. "They are pursuing the broadest mix of weapons, which means they're going to hold a vast array of targets at risk if we can't defeat them. So our focus out of the gate has been on resiliency of our architectures. Make the targeting as hard on the adversary as possible."</p><p>About a decade ago, the military recognized an imperative to transition to a new generation of satellites. Where they could, Pentagon officials replaced or complemented their fleets of a few large multibillion-dollar satellites with constellations of many more cheaper, relatively expendable satellites. If an adversary took out just one of the military's legacy satellites, commanders would feel the pain. But the destruction of multiple smaller satellites in the newer constellations wouldn't have any meaningful effect.</p><p>That's one of the reasons the military's Space Development Agency has started launching a network of small missile-tracking satellites in low-Earth orbit, and it's why the Pentagon is so interested in using services offered by SpaceX's Starlink broadband constellation. The Space Force is looking at ways to revamp its architecture for space-based navigation by potentially augmenting or replacing existing GPS satellites with an array of positioning platforms in different orbits.</p><p>"If you can disaggregate your missions from a few satellites to many satellites, you change the targeting calculus," Saltzman said. "If you can make things maneuverable, then it's harder to target, so that is the initial effort that we invested heavily on in the last few years to make us more resilient."</p><p>Now, Saltzman said, the Space Force must go beyond reshaping how it designs its satellites and constellations to respond to potential threats. These new options include more potent offensive and defensive weapons. He declined to offer specifics, but some options are better than others.</p><p>“Generally in a military setting, you don’t say, 'Hey, here's all the weapons, and here's how I'm going to use them, so get ready,'" Saltzman said. "That's not to our advantage... but I will generally [say] that I am far more enamored by systems that deny, disrupt, [and] degrade. There's a lot of room to leverage systems focused on those 'D words.' The destroy word comes at a cost in terms of debris."</p><p>A high-speed collision between an interceptor weapon and an enemy satellite would spread thousands of pieces of shrapnel across busy orbital traffic lanes, putting US and allied spacecraft at risk.</p><p>"We may get pushed into a corner where we need to execute some of those options, but I’m really focused on weapons that deny, disrupt, degrade," Saltzman said.</p><p>This tenet of environmental stewardship isn't usually part of the decision-making process for commanders in other military branches, like the Air Force or the Navy. "I tell my air-breathing friends all the time: When you shoot an airplane down, it falls out of your domain," Saltzman said.</p><p>China now operates more than 1,000 satellites, and more than a third of these are dedicated to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. China's satellites can collect high-resolution spy imagery and relay the data to terrestrial forces for military targeting. The Chinese "space-enabled targeting architecture... [is] pretty impressive," Saltzman said.</p><p>"We have a responsibility not only to defend the assets in space but to protect the war-fighter from space-enabled attack," said Lt. Gen. Doug Schiess, commander of Space Forces-Space. In this role, Schiess oversees Space Force units assigned to US Space Command.</p><p>"What China has done with an increasing launch pace is put up intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance satellites that can then target our naval forces, our land forces, and our air forces at much greater distance," Schiess said. "They've essentially built a huge kill chain, or kill web, if you will, to be able to target our forces much earlier."</p><p>China's aerospace forces have either deployed or are developing direct-ascent anti-satellite missiles, co-orbital satellites, electronic warfare platforms like mobile jammers, and directed-energy, or laser, systems, according to aPentagon reporton China's military and security advancements. These weapons can reach targets from low-Earth orbit all the way up to geosynchronous orbit.</p><p>In his role as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Saltzman advises the White House on military matters. Like most military commanders, he said he wants to offer his superiors as many options as possible. "The more weapons mix we have, the more options we can offer the president," Saltzman said.</p><p>The US military has already demonstrated it can shoot down a satellite with a ground-based interceptor, and the Space Force is poised to fieldnew ground-based satellite jammersin the coming months. The former head of the Space Force, Gen. Jay Raymond,told lawmakers in 2021that the military was developing directed-energy weapons to assure dominance in space, although he declined to discuss details in an unclassified hearing.</p><p>So the Pentagon is working on at least three of the six space weapons categories identified by Saltzman. China and Russia appear to have the edge in space-based weapons, at least for now.</p><p>In the last several years, Russia has tested a satellite that canfire a projectile capable of destroying another spacecraftin orbit, an example of a space-based kinetic weapon. Last year, news leaked that US intelligence officials are concerned about Russian plans toput a nuclear weapon in orbit. China launched a satellite named Shijian-17 in 2016 with a robotic arm that could be used to grapple and capture other satellites in space. Then, in 2021, China launched Shijian-21, which docked with a defunct Chinese satellite to take over its maneuvering and move it to a different orbit.</p><p>There's no evidence that the US Space Force has demonstrated kinetic space-based anti-satellite weapons, and Pentagon officials have roundly criticized the possibility of Russia placing a nuclear weapon in space. But the US military might soon develop space-based interceptors as part of theTrump administration's "Golden Dome" missile defense shield. These interceptors might also be useful in countering enemy satellites during conflict.</p><p>The Air Force used a robotic arm on a 2007 technology demonstration mission to snag free-flying satellites out of orbit, but this was part of a controlled experiment with a spacecraft designed for robotic capture. Several companies, such as Maxar andNorthrop Grumman, are developing robotic arms that could grapple "non-cooperative" satellites in orbit.</p><p>While the destruction of an enemy satellite is likely to be the Space Force's last option in a war, military commanders would like to be able to choose to do so. Schiess said the military "continues to have gaps" in this area.</p><p>"With destroy, we need that capability, just like any other domain needs that capability, but we have to make sure that we do that with responsibility because the space domain is so important," Schiess said.</p><p>The Space Force's fresh candor about orbital warfare should be self-evident, according to Saltzman. "Whywould you have a military space service if not to execute space control?"</p><p>This new comfort speaking about space weapons comes as the Trump administration strikes a more bellicose tone in foreign policy and national security. Pete Hegseth, Trump's secretary of defense, has pledged toreinforce a "warrior ethos"in the US armed services.</p><p>Space Force officials are doing their best to match Hegseth's rhetoric.</p><p>"Every guardian is a war-fighter, regardless of your functional specialty, and every guardian contributes to Space Force readiness," Saltzman said. Guardian is the military's term for a member of the Space Force, comparable to airmen, sailors, soldiers, and marines. "Whether you built the gun, pointed the gun, or pulled the trigger, you are a part of combat capability."</p><p>Echoing Hegseth, the senior enlisted member of the Space Force, Chief Master Sgt. John Bentivegna, said he's focused on developing a "war-fighter ethos" within the service. This involves training on scenarios of orbital warfare, even before the Space Force fields any next-generation weapons systems.</p><p>"As Gen. Saltzman is advocating for the money and the resources to get the kit, the culture, the space-minded war-fighter, that work has been going on and continues today," Bentivegna said.</p>

        <p>TwoWoTbook readers dive back into Amazon's increasingly divergent adaptation.</p><p>Andrew Cunningham and Lee Hutchinson have spent decades of their lives with Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson'sWheel of Timebooks, and they previously brought that knowledge to bear as theyrecapped each first season episodeandsecond season episodeof Amazon'sWoTTV series. Now we're back in the saddle for season three—along with insights, jokes, and the occasional wild theory.</p><p>These recaps won't cover every element of every episode, but they will contain major spoilers for the show and the book series. We'll do our best to not spoil major future events from the books, but there's always the danger that something might slip out.If you want to stay completely unspoiled and haven't read the books, these recaps aren't for you.</p><p>New episodes ofThe Wheel of Timeseason threewill be posted forAmazon Primesubscribers every Thursday. This write-up covers the entire three-episode season premiere, which was released on March 13.</p><p>Andrew: Yeah, I'm not saying I want to return to the days when every drama on TV had 26 hour-long episodes per season, but when you're doing one eight-episode run every year-and-a-half-to-two-years, you really feel those gaps. And maybe it's just[waves arms vaguely at The World], but I am genuinely happy to have this show back.</p><p>This season's premiere simply whips, balancing big action set-pieces and smaller character moments in between. But the whole production seems to be hitting a confident stride. The cast has gelled; they know what book stuff they're choosing to adapt and what they're going to skip. I'm sure there will still be grumbles, but the show does finally feel like it's become its own thing.</p><p>Lee: Oh yeah. The first episode hits the ground running, with explosions and blood and stolen ter’angreal. And we’ve got more than one episode to talk about—the gods of production at Amazon have given us a truly gigantic three-episode premiere, with each episode lasting more than an hour. Our content cup runneth over!</p><p>Trying to straight-up recap three hours of TV isn’t going to happen in the space we have available, so we’ll probably bounce around a bit. What I wanted to talk about first was exactly what you mentioned: unlike seasons one and two, this time, the show seems to have found itself and locked right in. To me, it feels kind of likeStar Trek: The Next Generation’s third season versus its first two.</p><p>Andrew: That's a good point of comparison. I feel like a lot of TV shows fall into one of two buckets: either it starts with a great first season and gradually falls off, or it gets off to a rocky start and finds itself over time. Fewer shows get to take the second path because a "show with a rocky start" often becomes a "canceled show," but they can be more satisfying to watch.</p><p>The one Big Overarching Plot Thing to know for book readers is that they're basically doing book 4 (The Shadow Rising) this season, with other odds and ends tucked in. So even if it gets canceled after this, at least they will have gotten to do what I think is probably the series' high point.</p><p>Lee: Yep, we find out in our very first episode this season that we’re going to be heading to the Aiel Waste rather than the southern city of Tear, which is a significant re-ordering of events from the books. But unlike some of the previous seasons’ changes that feel like they were forced upon the show by outside factors (COVID, actors leaving, and so on), this one feels like it serves a genuine narrative purpose. Rand is reciting the Prophesies of the Dragon to himself and he knows he needs the “People of the Dragon” to guarantee success in Tear, and while he’s not exactly sure who the "People of the Dragon" might be, it’s obvious that Rand has no army as of yet. Maybe the Aiel can help?</p><p>Rand is doing all of this because both the angel and the devil on Rand’s shoulders—that’s the Aes Sedai Moiraine Damodred with cute blue angel wings and the Forsaken Lanfear in fancy black leather BDSM gear—want him wielding Callandor, The Sword That is Not a Sword (as poor Mat Cauthon explains in the Old Tongue). This powerful sa’angreal is located in the heart of the Stone of Tear (it’s the sword in the stone, get it?!), and its removal from the Stone is a major prophetic sign that the Dragon has indeed come again.</p><p>Book three is dedicated to showing how all that happens—but, like you said, we’re not in book three anymore. We’re gonna eat our book 4 dessert before our book 3 broccoli!</p><p>Andrew: One of the bigger swerves that the show has taken with an established book character, I think! And well before she can claim to have been under the control of a Forsaken. (The other swerves I want to keep tabs on: Moiraine actively making frenemies with Lanfear to direct Rand, and Lan being the kind of guy who would ask Rand if he "wants to talk about it" when Rand is struggling emotionally. That one broke my brain, the books would be half as long as they are if men could openly talk to literally any other men about their states of mind.)</p><p>But I am totally willing to accept that Morgase change because the alternative is chapters and chapters of people yapping about consolidating political support anddaes dae'marand on and on. Bo-ring!</p><p>But speaking of Morgase and Forsaken, we're starting to spend a little time with all the new baddies who got released at the end of last season. How do you feel about the ones we've met so far? I know we were generally supportive of the fact that the show is just choosing to have fewer of them in the first place.</p><p>Lee: Hah, I loved the contrast with Book Lan, who appears to only be capable of feeling stereotypically manly feelings (like rage, shame, or the German word for when duty is heavier than a mountain, which I’m pretty sure is something like “Bergpflichtenschwerengesellschaften”). It continues to feel like all of our main characters have grown up significantly from their portrayals on the page—they have sex, they use their words effectively, and they emotionally support each other like real people do in real life. I’m very much here for that particular change.</p><p>But yes, the Forsaken. We know from season two that we’re going to be seeing fewer than in the books—I believe we’ve got eight of them to deal with, and we meet almost all of them in our three-episode opening blast. I’m very much enjoying Moghedien’s portrayal by Laia Costa, but of course Lanfear is stealing the show and chewing all the scenery. It will be fascinating to see how the show lets the others loose—we know from the books that every one of the Forsaken has a role to play (including one specific Forsaken whose existence has yet to be confirmed but who figures heavily into Rand learning more about how the One Power works), and while some of those roles can be dropped without impacting the story, several definitely cannot.</p><p>And although Elaida isn’t exactly a Forsaken, it was awesome to see Shohreh Aghdashloo bombing around the White Tower looking fabulous as hell. Chrisjen Avasarala would be proud.</p><p>Andrew: Maybe I'm exaggerating but I think Shohreh Aghdashloo'sactual voicegoes deeper than Hammed Animashaun's lowered-in-post-production voice for Loial. It's an incredible instrument.</p><p>Meeting Morgase in these early episodes means we also meet Gaebril, and the show only fakes viewers out for a few scenes before revealing what book-readers know: that he's the Forsaken Rahvin. But I really love how these scenes play, particularly his with Elayne. After one weird, brief look, they fall into a completely convincing chummy, comfortable stepdad-stepdaughter relationship, and right after that, you find out that, oops, nope, he's been there for like 15 minutes and has successfully One Power'deveryoneinto believing he's been in their lives for decades.</p><p>It's something that we're mostly told-not-shown in the books, and it really sells how powerful and amoral and manipulative all these characters are. Trust is extremely hard to come by in Randland, and this is why.</p><p>Lee: I very much liked the way Gaebril’s/Rahvin’s crazy compulsion comes off, and I also like the way Nuno Lopes is playing Gaebril. He seems perhaps a little bumbling, and perhaps a little self-effacing—truly, a lovable uncle kind of guy. The kind of guy who would say “thank you” to a servant and smile at children playing. All while, you know, plotting the downfall of the kingdom. In what is becoming a refrain, it’s a fun change from the books.</p><p>And along the lines of unassuming folks, we get our first look at a Gray Man and the hella creepy mechanism by which they’re created. I can’t recall in the books if Moghedien is explicitly mentioned as being able to fashion the things, but she definitely can in the show! (And it looks uncomfortable as hell. "Never accept an agreement that involves the forcible removal of one’s soul" is an axiom I try to live by.)</p><p>Andrew: It's just one of quite a few book things that these first few episodes speedrun. Mat has weird voices in his head and speaks in tongues! Egwene and Elayne pass the Accepted test! (Having spent most of an episode on Nynaeve's Accepted test last season, the show yada-yadas this a bit, showing us just a snippet of Egwene's Rand-related trials and none of Elayne's test at all.) Elayne's brothers Gawyn and Galad show up, and everyone thinks they're very hot, and Mat kicks their asses! The Black Ajah reveals itself in explosive fashion, and Siuan can only trust Elayne and Nynaeve to try and root them out! Min is here! Elayne and Aviendha kiss, making more of the books' homosexual subtext into actual text! But for the rest of the season, we split the party in basically three ways: Rand, Egwene, Moiraine and company head with Aviendha to the Waste, so that Rand can make allies of the Aiel. Perrin and a few companions head home to the Two Rivers and find that things are not as they left them. Nynaeve and Elayne are both dealing with White Tower intrigue. There are other threads, but I think this sets up most of what we'll be paying attention to this season.</p><p>As we try to wind down this talk about three very busy episodes, is there anything you aren't currently vibing with? I feel like Josha Stradowski's Rand is getting lost in the shuffle a bit, despite this nominally being his story.</p><p>Lee: I agree about Rand—but, hey, the same de-centering of Rand happened in the books, so at least there is symmetry. I think the things I’m not vibing with are at this point just personal dislikes. The sets still feel cheap. The costumes are great, but the Great Serpent rings are still ludicrously large and impractical.</p><p>I’m overjoyed the show is unafraid to shine a spotlight on queer characters, and I’m also desperately glad that we aren’t being held hostage by Robert Jordan’s kinks—like, we haven’t seen a single Novice or Accepted get spanked, women don’t peel off their tops in private meetings to prove that they’re women, and rather than titillation or weirdly uncomfortable innuendo, these characters are just straight-upscrewing.(The Amyrlin even notes that she’s not sure the Novices “will ever recover” after Gawyn and Galad come to—and all over—town.)</p><p>If I had to pick a moment that I enjoyed the most out of the premiere, it would probably be the entire first episode—which in spite of its length kept me riveted the entire time. I love the momentum, the feeling of finally getting the show that I’d always hoped we might get rather than the feeling of having to settle.</p><p>How about you? Dislikes? Loves?</p><p>Andrew: Not a ton of dislikes, I am pretty in the tank for this at this point. But I do agree that some of the prop work is weird. The Horn of Valere in particular looks less like a legendary artifact and more like a decorative pitcher from a Crate & Barrel.</p><p>There were two particular scenes/moments that I really enjoyed. Rand and Perrin and Mat justhang out, asfriends, for a while in the first episode, and it's very charming. We're told in the books constantly that these three boys are lifelong pals, but (to the point about Unavailable Men we were talking about earlier) we almost never get to see actual evidence of this, either because they're physically split up or because they're so wrapped up in their own stuff that they barely want to speak to each other.</p><p>I also really liked that brief moment in the first episode where a Black Ajah Aes Sedai's Warder dies, and she's like, "hell yeah, this feels awesome, this is making me horny because of how evil I am." Sometimes you don't want shades of gray—sometimes you just need some cartoonishly unambiguousvillainy.</p><p>Lee: I thought the Black Ajah getting excited over death wasjustthe right mix of cartoonishness and actual-for-realcreepiness, yeah. These people have sold their eternal souls to the Shadow, and it probably takes a certain type. (Though, as book readers know, there are some surprising Black Ajah reveals yet to be had!)</p><p>We close out our three-episode extravaganza with Mat having his famous stick fight withZoolander-esque male models Gawyn and Galad, Liandrin and the Black Ajah setting up shop (and tying off some loose ends) in Tanchico, Perrin meeting Faile and Lord Luc in the Two Rivers, and Rand in the Aiel Waste, preparing to do—well, something important, one can be sure.</p><p>We’ll leave things here for now. Expect us back next Friday to talk about episode four, which, based on the preview trailers already showing up online, will involve a certain city in the desert, wherein deep secrets will be revealed.</p><p>Mia dovienya nesodhin soende, Andrew!</p>

    <h1>Can we make AI less power-hungry? These researchers are working on it.</h1>

        <p>As demand surges, figuring out the performance of proprietary models is half the battle.</p><p>At the beginning of November 2024, the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected Amazon’s request to buy an additional 180 megawatts of power directly from the Susquehanna nuclear power plant for a data center located nearby. The rejection was due to the argument that buying power directly instead of getting it through the grid like everyone else works against the interests of other users.</p><p>Demand for power in the US has been flat for nearly 20 years. “But now we’re seeing load forecasts shooting up. Depending on [what] numbers you want to accept, they’re either skyrocketing or they’re just rapidly increasing,” said Mark Christie, a FERC commissioner.</p><p>Part of the surge in demand comes from data centers, and their increasing thirst for power comes in part from running increasingly sophisticated AI models. As with all world-shaping developments, what set this trend into motion was vision—quite literally.</p><p>Back in 2012, Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton, AI researchers at the University of Toronto, were busy working on a convolution neural network (CNN) for the ImageNet LSRVC, an image-recognition contest. The contest’s rules were fairly simple: A team had to build an AI system that could categorize images sourced from a database comprising over a million labeled pictures.</p><p>The task was extremely challenging at the time, so the team figured they needed a really big neural net—way bigger than anything other research teams had attempted. AlexNet, named after the lead researcher, had multiple layers, with over 60 million parameters and 650 thousand neurons. The problem with a behemoth like that was how to train it.</p><p>What the team had in their lab were a few Nvidia GTX 580s, each with 3GB of memory. As the researchers wrote in theirpaper, AlexNet was simply too big to fit on any single GPU they had. So they figured out how to split AlexNet’s training phase between two GPUs working in parallel—half of the neurons ran on one GPU, and the other half ran on the other GPU.</p><p>AlexNet won the 2012 competition by a landslide, but the team accomplished something way more profound. The size of AI models was once and for all decoupled from what was possible to do on a single CPU or GPU. The genie was out of the bottle.</p><p>(The AlexNet source code wasrecently made availablethrough the Computer History Museum.)</p><p>After AlexNet, using multiple GPUs to train AI became a no-brainer. Increasingly powerful AIs used tens of GPUs, then hundreds, thousands, and more. But it took some time before this trend started making its presence felt on the grid. According to an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)report, the power consumption of data centers was relatively flat between 2010 and 2020. That doesn’t mean the demand for data center services was flat, but the improvements in data centers’ energy efficiency were sufficient to offset the fact we were using them more.</p><p>Two key drivers of that efficiency were the increasing adoption of GPU-based computing and improvements in the energy efficiency of those GPUs. “That was really core to why Nvidia was born. We paired CPUs with accelerators to drive the efficiency onward,” said Dion Harris, head of Data Center Product Marketing at Nvidia. In the 2010–2020 period, Nvidia data center chips became roughly 15 times more efficient, which was enough to keep data center power consumption steady.</p><p>All that changed with the rise of enormous large language transformer models, starting with ChatGPT in 2022. “There was a very big jump when transformers became mainstream,” said Mosharaf Chowdhury, a professor at the University of Michigan. (Chowdhury is also at the ML Energy Initiative, a research group focusing on making AI more energy-efficient.)</p><p>Nvidia has kept up its efficiency improvements, with a ten-fold boost between 2020 and today. The company also kept improving chips that were already deployed. “A lot of where this efficiency comes from was software optimization. Only last year, we improved the overall performance of Hopper by about 5x,” Harris said. Despite these efficiency gains, based on Lawrence Berkely National Laboratory estimates, the US saw data center power consumptionshoot upfrom around 76 TWh in 2018 to 176 TWh in 2023.</p><p>LLMs work with tens of billions of neurons approaching a number rivaling—and perhaps even surpassing—those in the human brain. The GPT 4 is estimated to work with around 100 billion neurons distributed over 100 layers and over 100 trillion parameters that define the strength of connections among the neurons. These parameters are set during training, when the AI is fed huge amounts of data and learns by adjusting these values. That’s followed by the inference phase, where it gets busy processing queries coming in every day.</p><p>The training phase is a gargantuan computational effort—Open AI supposedly used over 25,000 Nvidia Ampere 100 GPUs running on all cylinders for 100 days. The estimated power consumption is 50 GW-hours, which is enough to power a medium-sized town for a year. According to numbersreleasedby Google, training accounts for 40 percent of the total AI model power consumption over its lifecycle. The remaining 60 percent is inference, where power consumption figures are less spectacular but add up over time.</p><p>The increasing power consumption has pushed the computer science community to think about how to keep memory and computing requirements down without sacrificing performance too much. “One way to go about it is reducing the amount of computation,” said Jae-Won Chung, a researcher at the University of Michigan and a member of the ML Energy Initiative.</p><p>One of the first things researchers tried was a technique called pruning, which aimed to reduce the number of parameters. Yann LeCun, now the chief AI scientist at Meta, proposed thisapproachback in 1989, terming it (somewhat menacingly) “the optimal brain damage.” You take a trained model and remove some of its parameters, usually targeting the ones with a value of zero, which add nothing to the overall performance. “You take a large model and distill it into a smaller model trying to preserve the quality,” Chung explained.</p><p>You can also make those remaining parameters leaner with a trick called quantization. Parameters in neural nets are usually represented as a single-precision floating point number, occupying 32 bits of computer memory. “But you can change the format of parameters to a smaller one that reduces the amount of needed memory and makes the computation faster,” Chung said.</p><p>Shrinking an individual parameter has a minor effect, but when there are billions of them, it adds up. It’s also possible to do quantization-aware training, which performs quantization at the training stage. According to Nvidia, which implemented quantization training in its AI model optimization toolkit, this should cut the memory requirements by 29 to 51 percent.</p><p>Pruning and quantization belong to a category of optimization techniques that rely on tweaking the way AI models work internally—how many parameters they use and how memory-intensive their storage is. These techniques are like tuning an engine in a car to make it go faster and use less fuel. But there's another category of techniques that focus on the processes computers use to run those AI models instead of the models themselves—akin to speeding a car up by timing the traffic lights better.</p><p>Apart from optimizing the AI models themselves, we could also optimize the way data centers run them. Splitting the training phase workload evenly among 25 thousand GPUs introduces inefficiencies. “When you split the model into 100,000 GPUs, you end up slicing and dicing it in multiple dimensions, and it is very difficult to make every piece exactly the same size,” Chung said.</p><p>GPUs that have been given significantly larger workloads have increased power consumption that is not necessarily balanced out by those with smaller loads. Chung figured that if GPUs with smaller workloads ran slower, consuming much less power, they would finish roughly at the same time as GPUs processing larger workloads operating at full speed. The trick was to pace each GPU in such a way that the whole cluster would finish at the same time.</p><p>To make that happen, Chung built a software tool called Perseus that identified the scope of the workloads assigned to each GPU in a cluster. Perseus takes the estimated time needed to complete the largest workload on a GPU running at full. It then estimates how much computation must be done on each of the remaining GPUs and determines what speed to run them so they finish at the same. “Perseus precisely slows some of the GPUs down, and slowing down means less energy. But the end-to-end speed is the same,” Chung said.</p><p>The team tested Perseus by training the publicly available GPT-3, as well as other large language models and a computer vision AI. The results were promising. “Perseus could cut up to 30 percent of energy for the whole thing,” Chung said. He said the team is talking about deploying Perseus at Meta, “but it takes a long time to deploy something at a large company.”</p><p>Are all those optimizations to the models and the way data centers run them enough to keep us in the green? It takes roughly a year or two to plan and build a data center, but it can take longer than that to build a power plant. So are we winning this race or losing? It’s a bit hard to say.</p><p>As the increasing power consumption of data centers became apparent, research groups tried to quantify the problem. A Lawerence Berkley Laboratory team estimated that data centers’ annual energy draw in 2028 would be between 325 and 580 TWh in the US—that’s between 6.7 and 12 percent of the total US electricity consumption. The International Energy Agency thinks it will be around 6 percent by 2026. Goldman Sachs Research says 8 percent by 2030, while EPRI claims between 4.6 and 9.1 percent by 2030.</p><p>EPRI also warns that the impact will be even worse because data centers tend to be concentrated at locations investors think are advantageous, like Virginia, which already sends 25 percent of its electricity to data centers. In Ireland, data centers are expected to consume one-third of the electricity produced in the entire country in the near future. And that’s just the beginning.</p><p>Running huge AI models like ChatGPT is one of the most power-intensive things that data centers do, but it accounts for roughly 12 percent of their operations, according to Nvidia. That is expected to change if companies like Google start to weave conversational LLMs into their most popular services. The EPRI report estimates that a single Google search today uses around 0.3 watts of power, while a single Chat GPT query bumps that up to 2.9 watts. Based on those values, the report estimates that an AI-powered Google search would require Google to deploy 400,000 new servers that would consume 22.8 TWh per year.</p><p>“AI searches take 10x the electricity of a non-AI search,” Christie, the FERC commissioner, said at a FERC-organized conference. When FERC commissioners are using those numbers, you’d think there would be rock-solid science backing them up. But when Ars asked Chowdhury and Chung about their thoughts on these estimates, they exchanged looks… and smiled.</p><p>Chowdhury and Chung don't think those numbers are particularly credible. They feel we know nothing about what's going on inside commercial AI systems like ChatGPT or Gemini, because OpenAI and Google have never released actual power-consumption figures.</p><p>“They didn’t publish any real numbers, any academic papers. The only number, 0.3 watts per Google search, appeared in someblog postor other PR-related thingy,” Chodwhury said. We don’t know how this power consumption was measured, on what hardware, or under what conditions, he said. But at least it came directly from Google.</p><p>“When you take that 10x Google vs ChatGPT equation or whatever—one part is half-known, the other part is unknown, and then the division is done by some third party that has no relationship with Google nor with Open AI,” Chowdhury said.</p><p>Google’s “PR-related thingy” was published back in 2009, while the 2.9-watts-per-ChatGPT-query figure was probably based on a comment about the number of GPUs needed to train GPT-4 made by Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, in 2024. That means the “10x AI versus non-AI search” claim was actually based on power consumption achieved on entirely different generations of hardware separated by 15 years. “But the number seemed plausible, so people keep repeating it,” Chowdhury said.</p><p>All reports we have today were done by third parties that are not affiliated with the companies building big AIs, and yet they arrive at weirdly specific numbers. “They take numbers that are just estimates, then multiply those by a whole lot of other numbers and get back with statements like ‘AI consumes more energy than Britain, or more than Africa, or something like that.’ The truth is they don’t know that,” Chowdhury said.</p><p>He argues that better numbers would require benchmarking AI models using a formal testing procedure that could be verified through the peer-review process.</p><p>As it turns out, the ML Energy Initiative defined just such a testing procedure and ran the benchmarks on any AI models they could get ahold of. The group then posted the results online on theirML.ENERGY Leaderboard.</p><p>To get good numbers, the first thing the ML Energy Initiative got rid of was the idea of estimating how power-hungry GPU chips are by using their thermal design power (TDP), which is basically their maximum power consumption. Using TDP was a bit like rating a car’s efficiency based on how much fuel it burned running at full speed. That’s not how people usually drive, and that’s not how GPUs work when running AI models. So Chung built ZeusMonitor, an all-in-one solution that measured GPU power consumption on the fly.</p><p>For the tests, his team used setups with Nvidia’s A100 and H100 GPUs, the ones most commonly used at data centers today, and measured how much energy they used running various large language models (LLMs), diffusion models that generate pictures or videos based on text input, and many other types of AI systems.</p><p>The largest LLM included in the leaderboard was Meta’s Llama 3.1 405B, an open-source chat-based AI with 405 billion parameters. It consumed 3352.92 joules of energy per request running on two H100 GPUs. That’s around 0.93 watt-hours—significantly less than 2.9 watt-hours quoted for ChatGPT queries. These measurements confirmed the improvements in the energy efficiency of hardware. Mixtral 8x22B was the largest LLM the team managed to run on both Ampere and Hopper platforms. Running the model on two Ampere GPUs resulted in 0.32 watt-hours per request, compared to just 0.15 watt-hours on one Hopper GPU.</p><p>What remains unknown, however, is the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4, Gemini, or Grok. The ML Energy Initiative team says it's very hard for the research community to start coming up with solutions to the energy efficiency problems when we don’t even know what exactly we’re facing. We can make estimates, but Chung insists they need to be accompanied by error-bound analysis. We don’t have anything like that today.</p><p>The most pressing issue, according to Chung and Chowdhury, is the lack of transparency. “Companies like Google or Open AI have no incentive to talk about power consumption. If anything, releasing actual numbers would harm them,” Chowdhury said. “But people should understand what is actually happening, so maybe we should somehow coax them into releasing some of those numbers.”</p><p>“Energy efficiency in data centers follows the trend similar to Moore’s law—only working at a very large scale, instead of on a single chip,” Nvidia's Harris said. The power consumption per rack, a unit used in data centers housing between 10 and 14 Nvidia GPUs, is going up, he said, but the performance-per-watt is getting better.</p><p>“When you consider all the innovations going on in software optimization, cooling systems, MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing), and GPUs themselves, we have a lot of headroom,” Harris said. He expects this large-scale variant of Moore’s law to keep going for quite some time, even without any radical changes in technology.</p><p>There are also more revolutionary technologies looming on the horizon. The idea that drove companies like Nvidia to their current market status was the concept that you could offload certain tasks from the CPU to dedicated, purpose-built hardware. But now, even GPUs will probably use their own accelerators in the future. Neural nets and other parallel computation tasks could be implemented on photonic chips that use light instead of electrons to process information. Photonic computing devices are orders of magnitude more energy-efficient than the GPUs we have today and can run neural networks literally at the speed of light.</p><p>Another innovation to look forward to is 2D semiconductors, which enable building incredibly small transistors and stacking them vertically, vastly improving the computation density possible within a given chip area. “We are looking at a lot of these technologies, trying to assess where we can take them,” Harris said. “But where rubber really meets the road is how you deploy them at scale. It’s probably a bit early to say where the future bang for buck will be.”</p><p>The problem is when we are making a resource more efficient, we simply end up using it more. “It is aJevons paradox, known since the beginnings of the industrial age. But will AI energy consumption increase so much that it causes an apocalypse? Chung doesn't think so. According to Chowdhury, if we run out of energy to power up our progress, we will simply slow down.</p><p>“But people have always been very good at finding the way,” Chowdhury added.</p>

    <h1>ISPs fear wave of state laws after New York’s $15 broadband mandate</h1>

        <p>When the FCC isn't regulating, states have more power to impose broadband laws.</p><p>New York's law requiring Internet service providers to offer broadband for$15 or $20 a monthhas spurred legislative efforts in other states to guarantee affordable service for people with low incomes. So far, legislators in Vermont, Massachusetts, and California have proposed laws inspired by the New York requirement.</p><p>Christopher Morrow, a newly elected Democratic state legislator in Vermont, introduced abillon January 29 that is modeled on New York's law. "Affordability is a big issue in Vermont and there are many stories of children who couldn't study properly during COVID for lack of Internet," Morrow told Ars. "It exposed the digital divide. This is a small gesture to help folks out."</p><p>Despite industry attempts to block the New York law and other broadband regulations, courts have made it clear that states can impose stricter requirements on Internet service when the Federal Communications Commission isn't regulating Internet providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. That's the situation right now after a federal appeals courtblocked a Biden-era FCC orderthat classified ISPs as common carriers and imposed net neutrality rules.</p><p>Even if the FCC had won that case, it likely would have deregulated the industry againunder Brendan Carr,the new chair selected by President Trump. Broadband was also deregulated at the federal level during Trump's first term when then-Chairman Ajit Pailed a voteto rescind net neutrality rules and Title II regulation.</p><p>Back then, California and other states stepped in to impose their own net neutrality rules. In that case, the California net neutrality law was pretty much identical to the abandoned federal rules.</p><p>By contrast, New York's law ordering ISPs to offer plans at specific prices was unlike any requirement imposed by the FCC. But the New York law survived court challenges for the same basic reason that saved the California net neutrality law: When the FCC isn't regulating, states can step in.</p><p>It's not just net neutrality and price laws. Maine approved abroadband privacy lawin 2019 that was similar to FCC regulations that were overturned byCongress and Trumpin 2017. ISPs sued to block the Maine law butgave upin 2022 after losing court decisions.</p><p>ISPs and their lobby groups opposed every FCC attempt to regulate broadband as a common carrier service but alsoarguethere shouldn't be a "patchwork" of state laws regulating broadband. Theyurged the Supreme Courtto strike down New York's law, saying that "other States are likely to copy New York once the Attorney General begins enforcing the ABA [Affordable Broadband Act] and New York consumers can buy broadband at below-market rates."</p><p>The Supreme Courtrejectedthe industry petition to review the law in December, and New York started enforcement the next month. Cable company Optimum failed to offer the required plans at first and had to update its marketing materials and internal processes afterArs pointed outthat it wasn't complying.</p><p>AT&Tstopped offeringits 5G home Internet service in New York entirely instead of complying with the law. But it would be much harder for AT&T to pull out of states where it offers copper or fiber-based Internet service. New York is outside AT&T's 21-state wireline territory.</p><p>We asked AT&T if it plans to lobby against similar bills in other states and whether it would also pull service out of states that impose similar rules. The company declined to comment.</p><p>This isn't the first time AT&T ended a service in protest of a state law. When California's net neutrality law prohibited ISPs from charging websites and online services for data cap exemptions (so-called "zero-rating"),AT&T endedits "sponsored data" program nationwide.</p><p>AT&T claimed at the time that it was impossible to follow the law in only one state. "We regret the inconvenience to customers caused by California's new 'net neutrality' law," AT&T said in March 2021. "Given that the Internet does not recognize state borders, the new law not only ends our ability to offer California customers such free data services but also similarly impacts our customers in states beyond California."</p><p>AT&T's claim was undermined by Verizonadvertisingdata-free streaming on Verizon Wireless with a note that it is "not available in California." It seems that Verizon figured out a way to offer different features in different US states.</p><p>We asked AT&T if it still believes that it would be impossible to comply with the zero-rating rule only in California. We also asked AT&T if it is complying with all of the requirements in the California net neutrality law throughout the US since it argued that the Internet does not recognize state borders. AT&T declined to answer our questions, and a spokesperson said that "most of the things you asked about are industry-wide issues not specific to AT&T."</p><p>"AT&T's claims were and continue to be false," Stanford Law School professor Barbara van Schewick, a prominent net neutrality supporter, told Ars. Van Schewick is also director of Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.</p><p>The California net neutrality law is the only state-level law that matches all of the protections in the FCC rules that are no longer enforced, van Schewick said. But contrary to AT&T's claims, she says it's possible for ISPs to comply in California and implement other policies in different states.</p><p>"If an ISP decides to comply with California's net neutrality law nationwide, that's its choice. California's net neutrality law does not demand that," and "implementing net neutrality state by state isn't a technical challenge," she said.</p><p>The credibility of AT&T's claims about the effects of a state law is relevant again because the broadband industry is using AT&T's exit from New York in a renewed attempt to get the Supreme Court's attention. Lobby groups filed asupplemental briefon January 17 urging the court to reconsider its denial of their petition.</p><p>"As we noted in our petition for rehearing, [New York's law] created a 'serious risk that... some providers will cease offering broadband service in New York rather than sell at a loss.' That risk has come to pass," the brief said. "AT&T has withdrawn its 5G fixed wireless home internet offering—AT&T Internet Air—from New York because of the rate-regulation law."</p><p>AT&T pulling its 5G home Internet service out of New York is nowhere near as significant as a wireline provider pulling service out of a state. The industry brief acknowledged that the service's availability in New York was limited to 10 cities and towns.</p><p>AT&T would have a particularly tough time pulling wireline service out of California, which is the only state that hasn't granted AT&T's request for deregulation of old copper telephone networks. AT&T is trying to exit the copper business, even though itwon't build fiber home Internetin half of its wireline footprint. But AT&T is still classified as a Carrier of Last Resort (COLR) in California, so its copper retirement could take much longer in that state.</p><p>AT&T's fiber and copper-based Internet services could fall under a proposed California law to require low-cost plans. The California proposal is vague right now, though—it doesn't yet specify required speeds or prices.</p><p>TheCalifornia billsubmitted by Democratic Assemblymember Tasha Boerner on January 30 leaves those decisions for later. "It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation that would require broadband internet service providers to offer affordable home Internet to California residents," the bill says.</p><p>A spokesperson for Boerner told Ars that the legislator's team is gathering more details as it waits to see what happens with the Supreme Court.</p><p>The New Yorklawrequires ISPs with over 20,000 customers in the state to offer $15 broadband plans with download speeds of at least 25Mbps, or $20-per-month service with 200Mbps speeds. The plans must be offered to people who meet income-eligibility requirements.</p><p>Morrow's bill in Vermont adopts the same speeds and prices. TheMassachusetts billsubmitted by Democrat Pavel Payano goes further, proposing that ISPs provide at least 100Mbps speeds for $15 a month or 200Mbps for $20 a month.</p><p>Boerner'spress releaseannouncing the vaguer California bill said the "legislation comes at a pivotal time as roughly three million California households lost federal support" whenCongress allowedthe Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) and its $30 low-income discounts to expire last year. "Finding the right solution for California will require thoughtful engagement and collaboration from all sides of this issue," Boerner said.</p><p>The nonprofit California Community Foundation will be involved in discussions. "We look forward to working with the Assemblymember to develop and pass the legislation," Shayna Englin, who directs the group's Digital Equity Initiative, said in Boerner's press release. Englin said the "bill offers the legislature an opportunity to swiftly respond to the cost-of-living crisis plaguing residents and reduce their financial burdens long-term."</p><p>Broadband lobby groups can be expected to fight any state-level bills that require offering plans at specific prices to people with low incomes. "Any attempt by individual states to regulate prices or other parts of the broadband market will undermine all of the connectivity progress we have made, discourage investment, and end up hurting consumers," lobby group USTelecom told Ars.</p><p>USTelecom represents AT&T, Verizon, Lumen (aka CenturyLink) and other telcos. It defended its members' prices. "Despite overall inflation soaring, broadband prices have been dropping while speeds are getting faster in today's extremely competitive communications market. Consumers get tremendous value from their broadband subscriptions," the group said.</p><p>USTelecom's claim of dropping prices is based on ananalysis the lobby group commissioned. The analysis uses a "BPI-Speed" index created by USTelecom, which is said to include "providers' most popular services between 100Mbps and 940Mbps."</p><p>USTelecom says that real prices for offerings between 100Mbps and 940Mbps have dropped nearly 60 percent since 2015, but this is no surprise given the rising numerical value of what most people consider to be modern Internet speeds. Back in 2015, the cable industryopposed a planto increase a federal broadband standard from 4Mbps to 25Mbps. The FCC now uses astandardof 100Mbps.</p><p>A different price analysis by the Technology Policy Institute, an independent think tank, is based on government data andsaidthat "from 2016 to 2022, average household spending on Internet services increased from about $54 per month to approximately $74. The increase could reflect changing preferences as people move to higher, more expensive tiers or price increases that we cannot observe in advertised plans."</p><p>Morrow told Ars he is concerned about his bill facing opposition from Internet providers, though he noted Comcast already offers a low-cost plan in Vermont that "just needs to be advertised better." Morrow said he modeled his bill on the New York law and that he is optimistic about its passage.</p><p>"I am optimistic, but there is a lot going on right now, so it is certainly not guaranteed," he said.</p><p>More state bills are expected. "A number of states will consider stepping into the vacuum left by the FCC and the courts deciding that the FCC does not have jurisdiction over broadband networks and Congress letting the ACP expire," New Street Research Policy Advisor Blair Levin told Ars. Levin was chief of staff to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt during the Clinton years and oversaw the writing of the US National Broadband Plan during the Obama administration.</p><p>"I expect more [states] will focus on helping low-income households than on net neutrality," Levin continued. "There may be other broadband-related issues that states may explore, including but not limited to network resiliency, public safety, and billing transparency."</p><p>ISPs will fight the laws at the state level and urge the FCC to preempt them, Levin noted. But the FCClost an attemptto preempt all state net neutrality laws during the first Trump administration, with a federal appeals court saying that "in any area where the Commission lacks the authority to regulate, it equally lacks the power to preempt state law."</p><p>States should not view legal challenges as a major roadblock, van Schewick told Ars. "The case law is now abundantly clear that when the FCC is powerless to protect consumers online, the states can step in to protect their residents," she said. "They can create their own net neutrality protections, like California and others do, require affordable broadband options like New York, and institute broadband privacy protections like Maine. All of these laws have been upheld in court."</p>

    <h1>Old Bolt, new tricks: Making an EV into a backup power station with an inverter</h1>

        <p>Using a custom kit to make a budget EV offer some emergency power.</p><p>Back when EV enthusiasm was higher, there werefitsandstartsof vehicle-to-home concepts and products. If EVs and their ginormous batteries are expensive, resource-intensive purchases, the thinking went, maybe we should get something more out of them than just groceries and school pick-ups. Maybe we could find other things for that huge battery to do duringthe 95 percent of time it spends parkedin or near our homes.</p><p>An EV powering your whole home, or even pushing power back to the grid, is something higher-end EVs might do at some point with some utilities.I have a Chevy Bolt, an EV that does not have even a three-prong 110 V plug on it, let alone power-your-home potential. If I wanted to keep the essentials running during an outage, it seemed like I needed to buy a fuel-based generator—or one of thosebig portable power stations.</p><p>Or so I thought, until I came across inverter kits. Inverters take the direct current available from your vehicle's 12V battery—the lead-acid brick inside almost every car—and turns it into alternating current suitable for standard plugs. Inverters designed for car batteries have been around a long time, opening up both novel and emergency uses. The catch is that you have to start the car's gas engine often enough to keep the battery charged.</p><p>What's different about this Bolt-specific kit is that the inverter pulls power from the 12 V battery, which in turn pulls from the car's larger battery, the high-voltage one that makes it actually drive. And given that it's an EV without emissions, it's OK to keep it running in the garage. It's by no means a whole-home solution—my kit maker,EV Extend, recommends drawing just 1,000 watts of continuous power so as not to drain the battery too far or damage the electronics. But it's certainly better than having only flashlights, USB battery packs, and the power utility's website open on your phone.</p><p>What can you do with 1,000 W, plus a bit of "surge" overhead for devices that kick on strong, like a refrigerator? I can't run my home's central HVAC system, so an outage in the depths of a DC summer, or the occasionally painful winter, would still be unpleasant. There are only three receptacles, and they're inside the car hood, so everything that needs power has to be reached by extension cord (and you don't want to go too far with those). The car is also unlocked and running, with its key fob nearby, so it can't be left alone.</p><p>But for backup power I never planned to have, in an area where outages are less frequent, I have something like minimum viable backup power. With properly rated extension cords, I could run fans, a small space heater, or a single-room-sized window A/C unit for a day or two on conservative settings. I could, if my fiber provider is still up, keep the Internet and router running. At a minimum, I could keep a lot of distraction devices running with the Bolt's 64–66 kW battery (assuming I fully charged it before an outage).</p><p>I have not had a chance to really test this inverter, as the residential power in Washington, DC, has been stubbornly reliable since I bought it. But I did run it for about an hour mid-day to try out some of my assumptions.</p><p>I bought a $444 kit fromEV Extend, which specializes ininverter packagesfor the non-flashy and early adopter EVs: Chevy Bolts and Volts and Nissan Leafs. I opted for a 1,500 W pure sinewave inverter, capable of briefly handling surges of up to 3,000 W. The inverter itself is a commodity, and you can find it lots of places. The things I was really buying with this kit were:</p><p>The owner of EV Extendmakes a point of not offering his instruction manuals publicly. This is in part for "low-volume niche market" reasons. But it's also because of a real concern that folks will see EV Extend setups, do some "I could rig that together" thinking, and expose themselves to a whole bunch of electrical, mechanical, or safety problems. He's not opposed to DIY-ers, he writes, so much as he'sconcerned about wiring quality and bad assumptions.</p><p>From the images onEV Extend's siteand various Reddit installs, you can get the gist. A big brick of an inverter, with two thick cables running to a gray connector, and another connector plug running out from the 12 V battery area, easily tucked away (with velcro) when not in use. You can buy more or less surge protection, opt to skip pure sinewave inversion (not a great ideaif you're powering electronics), or upgrade and get a remote switch. But they are all largely the same.</p><p>Among the frequently asked questions on the product page is "will this void my warranty?"</p><p>The answer: No, it should not, because theMagnuson-Moss Warranty Actstill exists, so there needs to be proof that this damaged your 12 V system. But there is also the unwritten caveat that it can still be very painful if your car maker or dealer is not up on their consumer rights laws.</p><p>My installation took about 20 minutes. It involved some socket-wrenching, and I had to saw off an inconvenient but inessential plastic bit. The toughest part involved fishing some stiff, thick wire through a space between the coolant tank and a metal bracket (which the manual warned about).</p><p>That night, I connected the inverter, turned on the Bolt, flipped on the inverter, and plugged in a USB-C wall plug. I connected an iPad, it started charging, and I felt a weird sense of accomplishment at having found one of the most expensive and inefficient ways to watch YouTube. For a few hours, I held some project-completing pride.</p><p>Later that night, the myChevrolet app flung about a dozen notifications at me. The gist: Every single system on the Bolt was failing, I needed to have it towed to a dealer, and I was wrong to try and redistribute its precious electrons. These were bad messages to receive in the middle of brushing my teeth, and sleep did not come easy.</p><p>Why the panic? The majority of EVs, however sophisticated, are heavily dependent on their old-fashioned 12 V batteries. This is due in part to how many of an EV's ancillaries—locks, lights, infotainment, power steering, and more—are designed to run at 12 V, in common with the rest of the auto industry. But it's also because when an EV's higher-voltage traction battery is off, it needs to be fully off and de-energized, and the 12 V helps switch it off and keep residual systems running (Inside EVs has a good explainer on this). Disconnecting my 12 V battery, even for just a minute to attach a connector, gave the car fits about lacking this crucial reserve of juice.</p><p>It's weird, and it can bequite frustrating in the wrong circumstances. But the next morning, I started the Bolt, let it idle for a few minutes, and all the divinations of doom disappeared from the Chevy app. Six months later, I have yet to see any others. I've taken my car in for a general check-up since, and the mechanic made no note of my velcro-anchored connector.</p><p>The inverter hook-ups were set, but household power remained stubbornly stable for months, so I decided to stage a pretend outage. Could the Bolt keep me and my wife reasonably comfortable in my office, the next room over from the garage? Could I keep a space heater or window air conditioning unit running, with occasional kick-on surges? What about the fridge? And how annoying would it be to have the car running in neutral in my garage the whole time?</p><p>Here's what I figured could fit into 1,000 W from the inverter and its three outlets, using appropriately sized and rated extension cords:</p><p>I unplugged the Bolt, opened the hood, placed the inverter on a reasonably flat part of the compartment (next time, I will have a flat piece of wood to place there), turned on the car, and flipped on the inverter. So far, so good!</p><p>Because the car was in park, it would automatically shut itself off after two hours. A number of committed campers and preppers on Reddit have suggested putting the car in neutral, engaging the parking brake (or puttingchocksbehind the rear wheels), and exiting the car from the passenger side (as opening the driver side door can make the car auto-shift for safety). Because it's not in park at a low speed, the Bolt will make a whirring noise for pedestrian safety. I could temporarily cancel it by pulling the right fuse from the engine compartment box, so long as I left a note for myself with big letters to put it back in.</p><p>I first plugged in my desk and all its accompaniments, then nudged and woke up my laptop and monitor: 14.7 watts. That seemed a bit low, given that monitors are typically more than 20 watts, but the inverter is perhaps slow to report the full draw. Still, there was lots of headroom remaining.</p><p>Adding in the fiber-optic modem, the Dream Machine Pro router (specified at a 50 W maximum power draw), and its PoE-based devices boosted the number to 90 watts. That left 910 watts, which felt like a lot until I plugged in the big space heater and set it to its lowest setting. Once the heater had been on for a bit, I was at 850–860 watts, combined with the other gear. I knew space heaters were inefficient in a broad sense, but now that fact is burned into my brain in little red digits.</p><p>All these things ran off the inverter for about 30 minutes (I wrote the previous two paragraphs with mostly inverter power), floating between 810 and 920 watts, and I saw the car's projected mileage dip one mile when I checked on it. If I had the Bolt fully charged, I might get a maximum of 60 hours of this, or 48 hours at my typical 80 percent charge, give or take some resistance and use variables. Given what I learned, I would need to use a smaller space heater or very light air conditioning if I also wanted to keep the fridge running without nervous monitoring (and make up for some loss to an extension cord). That, or hope the power only goes out during comfortable temperatures.</p><p>But I'm using the Bolt and inverter as a just-in-case option, not something I would lean on if regular multi-day outages were occurring. It would also be quite useful for car camping, though I can't speak to that personally. The process has, like most DIY projects, taught me some things: about power draw, EVs, and my priorities. If you have a similarly nifty but not exactly new EV, consider checking out your inversion options for it—after you fully understand the limits and know-how required.</p><p>This post was updated at 10:30 a.m. Eastern on March 17 to clean up references to inversion, which the non-engineer author regrets for their initial fuzziness. “Plugs” and “receptacles” were also better distinguished.</p>

    <h1>Better than the real thing? Spark 2 packs 33 amp sims into $300 Bluetooth speaker</h1>

        <p>Digital amp modeling goes very, very portable.</p><p>TheSpark 2 from Positive Gridlooks like a miniature old-school amp, but it is, essentially, a computer with some knobs and a speaker. It has Bluetooth, USB-C, and an associated smartphone app. It needs firmware updates, which can brick the device—ask me how I found this out—and it runs code on DSP chips. New guitar tones can be downloaded into the device, where they run as software rather than as analog electrical circuits in an amp or foot pedal.</p><p>In other words, the Spark 2 is the latest example of the "software-ization" of music.</p><p>Forget the old image of a studio filled with a million-dollar, 48-track mixing board from SSL or API and bursting with analog amps, vintage mics, and ginormous plate reverbs. Studios today are far more likely to be digital, where people record "in the box" (i.e., they track and mix on a computer running software like Pro Tools or Logic Pro) using digital models of classic (and expensive) amplifiers, coded by companies like NeuralDSP and IK Multimedia. These modeled amp sounds are then run through convolution software that relies on digital impulse responses captured from different speakers and speaker cabinets. They are modified with effects like chorus and distortion, which are all modeled, too. The results can be world-class, and they're increasingly showing up on records.</p><p>Once the sounds are recorded, a mixer will often use digital plugins to replicate studio gear like tape delays, FET compressors, and reverbs (which may be completely algorithmic or may rely on impulse responses captured from real halls, studios, plates, and spring reverbs). These days, even the microphones might be digitally modeled by companies like Slate, Antelope, and Universal Audio.</p><p>This has put incredible power into the hands of home musicians; for a couple of thousand bucks, most home studios can own models of gear that would have cost more than a house 20 years ago. But one downside of this shift to software is that all the annoying quirks of computing devices have followed.</p><p>Want to rock out to the classic Marshall tones found in Universal Audio's "Lion" amp simulator plugin? Just plug your guitar into your audio interface, connect the interface to a computer via USB, launch a DAW, instantiate the plugin on a blank track, choose the correct input, activate input monitoring so you can hear the results of your jamming, and adjust your DAW's buffer size to something small in an attempt to prevent latency. A problem with any item on that list means "no jamming for you."</p><p>You may be prompted to update the firmware in your audio interface, or to update your operating system, or to update your DAW—or even its plugins. Oh, and did I mention that Universal Audio uses the truly terrible iLok DRM system and that if your Wi-Fi drops for even a few minutes, the plugins will deactivate? Also, you'll need to run a constant companion app in the background called UA Connect, which itself can be prone to problems.</p><p>Assuming everything is up to date and working, you're still tethered to your computer by a cable, and you have to make all your settings tweaks with a mouse. After a day of working on computers, this is not quite how I want to spend my "music time."</p><p>But the upsides of digital modeling are just too compelling to return to the old, appliance-like analog gear. For one thing, the analog stuff isexpensive. The Lion amp plugin mentioned above gives you not one but several versions of a high-quality Marshall head unit—each one costing thousands of dollars—but you don't need to lift it (they're heavy!), mic it (annoying!), or play it at absurdly low levels because your baby is sleeping upstairs. For under a hundred bucks, you can get that sound of an overdriven Marshall turned up to 75 percent and played through several different speaker cabinet options (each of these is also expensive!) right on your machine.</p><p>Or consider theTone King Imperial Mk II, a $2,700, Fender-style amp built in the US. It sounds great. But NeuralDSP offers astunning digital modelfor a hundred bucks—and it comes with compressor, overdrive, delay, and reverb pedals, to say nothing of a tuner, a doubler, a pitch-shifter, and a ton of great presets.</p><p>So I want the digital amp modeling, but I also want—sometimes, at least—the tactile simplicity of physical knobs and well-built hardware. Or I want to jack in and play without waking up a computer, logging in, launching apps, or using a mouse and an audio interface. Or I want to take my amp models to places where finicky computers aren't always welcome, like the stage of a club.</p><p>Thanks to hardware like the Profiler fromKemper, the Helix gear fromLine6, theCortex pedalboards from NeuralDSP, orTonex gearfrom IK Multimedia, this is increasingly common.</p><p>The Spark line from Positive Grid has carved out its own niche in this world by offering well-built little amps that run Positive Grid's digital amp and effects simulations. (If you don't want the hardware, the companysells its modeling softwarefor PC and Mac under the "Bias" label.)</p><p>The Spark 2 is the latest in this line, and I've been putting it through its paces over the last couple of months.</p><p>Let's cut right to the conclusion: The Spark 2 is a well-designed, well-built piece of gear. For $300, you get a portable, 50-watt practice amp and Bluetooth speaker that can store eight guitar tones onboard and download thousands more using a smartphone app. Its models aren't, to my ears, the most realistic out there, but if you want a device to jack into and jam, to play along with backing tracks or loops, or to record some creative ideas, this fits the bill.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Everything about the Spark 2 feels well-built. The unit is surprisingly solid, and it comes with a carrying strap for portability. If you want to truly live the wire-free lifestyle, you can buy a battery pack for $79 that gives you several hours of juice.</p><p>For a practice amp, the Spark 2 is also well-connected. It has Bluetooth for streaming audio—but it also has a 3.5 mm aux in jack. It has decent, if somewhat boxy-sounding, speakers, and they get quite loud—but it also has two quarter-inch line out jacks. It has a guitar input jack and a headphone jack. It can use a power supply or a battery. It can connect to a computer via USB, and you can even record that way if you don't have another audio interface.</p><p>Most of the unit's top is taken up with chunky knobs. These let you select one of the eight onboard presets or adjust model parameters like gain, EQ, modulation, delay, and reverb. There's also a knob for blending your guitar audio with music played through the device.</p><p>Buttons provide basic access to a tuner and a looper, though the associated app unlocks more complex options.</p><p>So about that app. It's not necessary to use the Spark 2, but you'll need the app if you want to download or create new tones from the many pieces of modeled gear. Options here go far beyond what's possible with the knobs atop the physical unit.</p><p>Spark models a chamber reverb, for instance, which is basically a reflective room into which a speaker plays sound that a microphone picks up. The Spark chamber lets you adjust the volume level of the reverb signal, the reflection time of the chamber, the "dwell" time of the sound in the room, the amount of sound damping, and whether the sound will have some of its lows or highs cut off. (This is common in reverbs to avoid excessive low-end "mud" or top-end "brightness" building up in the reverberating signal.) You'll need the app to adjust most of these options; the "reverb" control on the Spark 2 simply changes the level.</p><p>There's a fair bit of modeled gear on offer: one noise gate, six compressors, 14 drive pedals, 33 amps, 13 EQ units, six delays, and nine reverbs. Most of these have numerous options. It is not nearly as overwhelming as a package likeAmplitubefor PCs and Macs, but it's still a lot of stuff.</p><p>To run it all, Positive Grid has beefed up the computational power of the Spark series. The company told me that digital signal processing power has doubled since the original Spark lineup, which allows for "smoother transitions between tones, richer effects, and an expanded memory for presets and loops." The system runs on an M7 chip "developed specifically for expanded processing power and precise tone reproduction," and the extra power has allowed Positive Grid to run more complex models on-device, improving their preamp andamplifier sagmodeling.</p><p>Despite the DSP increase, the results here just don't compare with the sort of scary-precise tube amp and effects simulations you can run on a computer or a far more expensive hardware modeling rig. I could never get clean and "edge of breakup" tones to sound anything other than artificial, though some of the distortion sounds were quite good. Reverbs and delays also sounded solid.</p><p>But the Spark 2 wasn't really designed for studio-quality recording, and Positive Grid is candid about this. The models running on the Spark 2 are inspired by the company's computer work, but they are "optimized for an all-in-one, mobile-friendly playing experience," I was told. The Spark 2 is meant for "practice, jamming, and basic recording," and those looking for "studio-level control and complex setups" should seek out something else.</p><p>This tracks with my experience. Compared to a regular amp, the Spark 2 is crazy portable. When testing the unit, I would haul it between rooms without a second thought, searching for a place to play that wouldn't annoy some member of my family. (Headphones? Never!) Thanks to the optional battery, I didn't even need to plug it in. It was a simple, fun way to get some electric guitar practice in without using a screen or a computer, and its sound could fill an entire room. Compared to the weight and hassle of moving a "real" amp, this felt easy.</p><p>I've been talking about the Spark 2 and its screen-free experience, but of course you do need to use the app to unlock more advanced features and download new tones onto the hardware. So how good is the software?</p><p>For modifying the gear in your presets, the app works fine. Every piece of gear has a nice picture, and you just flick up or down to get a piece of equipment into or out of the effects chain. Changing parameters is simple, with large numbers popping up on screen whenever you touch a virtual control, and you can draw from a huge library of pre-made effect chains.</p><p>The app also features plenty of backing music that it can play over the Spark 2. This includes backing tracks, tabbed songs, and the "groove looper," giving you plenty of options to work on your soloing, but it's the artificial intelligence that Positive Grid is really pitching this time around.</p><p>You are legally required to shoehorn "AI" into every product launch now, and Positive Grid put its AI tools into the app. These include Smart Jam, which tries to adapt to your playing and accompany it in real time. The company tells me that Smart Jam was "trained on a combination of musical datasets that analyze chord structures, song patterns, and rhythmic elements," but I could never get great results from it. Because the system doesn't know what you're going to play in advance, there was always a herky-jerky quality as it tried to adapt its backing track to my changing performance.</p><p>I had more success with Spark AI, which is a natural language tone-shaping engine. You tell the system what you're looking for—the solo in "Stairway to Heaven," perhaps—and it returns several presets meant to approximate that sound. It doeswork, I'll say that. The system reliably gave me tone options that were, with a little imagination, identifiable as "in the ballpark" of what I asked for.</p><p>Perhaps the main barrier here is simply that the current Spark amp models aren't always powerful enough to truly copy the sounds you might be looking for. Spark AI is a great way to pull up a tone that's appropriate for whatever song you might be practicing, and to do so without forcing you to build it yourself out of pieces of virtual gear. In that sense, it's a nice practice aid.</p><p>As it's pitched—a practice amp and Bluetooth speaker that costs $300—Spark 2 succeeds. It's such a well-built and designed unit that I enjoyed using it every time I played, even if the tones couldn't match a real tube amp or even top-quality models. And the portability was more useful than expected, even when just using it around the house.</p><p>As DSP chips grow ever more powerful, I'm looking forward to where modeling can take us. For recording purposes, some of the best models will continue to run on powerful personal computers. But for those looking to jam, or to play shows, or to haul a guitar to the beach for an afternoon, hardware products running modeling software offer incredible possibilities already—and they will "spark" even more creativity in the years to come.</p>

    <h1>AI versus the brain and the race for general intelligence</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>We already have an example of general intelligence, and it doesn't look like AI.</p><p>There's no question that AI systems have accomplished some impressive feats, mastering games, writing text, and generating convincing images and video. That's gotten some people talking about the possibility that we're on the cusp of AGI, or artificial general intelligence. While some of this is marketing fanfare, enough people in the field are taking the idea seriously that it warrants a closer look.</p><p>Many arguments come down to the question of how AGI is defined, which people in the field can't seem to agree upon. This contributes to estimates of its advent that range from "it's practically here" to "we'll never achieve it." Given that range, it's impossible to provide any sort of informed perspective on how close we are.</p><p>But we do have an existing example of AGI without the "A"—the intelligence provided by the animal brain, particularly the human one. And one thing is clear: The systems being touted as evidence that AGI is just around the corner do not work at all like the brain does. That may not be a fatal flaw, or even a flaw at all. It's entirely possible that there's more than one way to reach intelligence, depending on how it's defined. But at least some of the differences are likely to be functionally significant, and the fact that AI is taking a very different route from the one working example we have is likely to be meaningful.</p><p>With all that in mind, let's look at some of the things the brain does that current AI systems can't.</p><p>Artificial general intelligence hasn't really been defined. Those who argue that it's imminent are either vague about what they expect the first AGI systems to be capable of or simply define it as the ability to dramatically exceed human performance at a limited number of tasks. Predictions of AGI's arrival in the intermediate term tend to focus on AI systems demonstrating specific behaviors that seem human-like. The further one goes out on the timeline, the greater the emphasis on the "G" of AGI and its implication of systems that are far less specialized.</p><p>But most of these predictions are coming from people working in companies with a commercial interest in AI. It was notable that none of the researchers we talked to for this article were willing to offer a definition of AGI. They were, however, willing to point out how current systems fall short.</p><p>"I think that AGI would be something that is going to be more robust, more stable—not necessarily smarter in general but more coherent in its abilities," saidAriel Goldstein, a researcher at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "You'd expect a system that can do X and Y to also be able to do Z and T. Somehow, these systems seem to be more fragmented in a way. To be surprisingly good at one thing and then surprisingly bad at another thing that seems related."</p><p>"I think that's a big distinction, this idea of generalizability," echoed neuroscientistChrista Bakerof NC State University. "You can learn how to analyze logic in one sphere, but if you come to a new circumstance, it's not like now you're an idiot."</p><p>Mariano Schain, a Google engineer who has collaborated with Goldstein, focused on the abilities that underlie this generalizability. He mentioned both long-term and task-specific memory and the ability to deploy skills developed in one task in different contexts. These are limited-to-nonexistent in existing AI systems.</p><p>Beyond those specific limits, Baker noted that "there's long been this very human-centric idea of intelligence that only humans are intelligent." That's fallen away within the scientific community as we've studied more about animal behavior. But there's still a bias to privilege human-like behaviors, such as the human-sounding responses generated by large language models</p><p>The fruit flies that Baker studies can integrate multiple types of sensory information, control four pairs of limbs, navigate complex environments, satisfy their own energy needs, produce new generations of brains, and more. And they do that all with brains that contain under 150,000 neurons, far fewer than current large language models.</p><p>These capabilities are complicated enough that it's not entirely clear how the brain enables them. (If we knew how, it might be possible to engineer artificial systems with similar capacities.) But we do know a fair bit about how brains operate, and there are some very obvious ways that they differ from the artificial systems we've created so far.</p><p>Most current AI systems, including all large language models, are based on what are called neural networks. These were intentionally designed to mimic how some areas of the brain operate, with large numbers of artificial neurons taking an input, modifying it, and then passing the modified information on to another layer of artificial neurons. Each of these artificial neurons can pass the information on to multiple instances in the next layer, with different weights applied to each connection. In turn, each of the artificial neurons in the next layer can receive input from multiple sources in the previous one.</p><p>After passing through enough layers, the final layer is read and transformed into an output, such as the identity of the pixels in an image that correspond to a cat.</p><p>While that system is modeled on the behavior of some structures within the brain, it's a very limited approximation. For one, all artificial neurons are functionally equivalent—there's no specialization. In contrast, real neurons are highly specialized; they use a variety of neurotransmitters and take input from a range of extra-neural factors like hormones. Some specialize in sending inhibitory signals while others activate the neurons they interact with. Different physical structures allow them to make different numbers of connections.</p><p>In addition, rather than simply forwarding a single value to the next layer, real neurons communicate through an analog series of activity spikes, sending trains of pulses that vary in timing and intensity. This allows for a degree of non-deterministic noise in communications.</p><p>Finally, while organized layers are a feature of a few structures in brains, they're far from the rule. "What we found is it's—at least in the fly—much more interconnected," Baker told Ars. "You can't really identify this strictly hierarchical network."</p><p>With near-complete connection maps of the fly brain becoming available, she told Ars that researchers are "finding lateral connections or feedback projections, or what we call recurrent loops, where we've got neurons that are making little circle-like connectivity patterns. I think those things are probably going to be a lot more widespread than we currently appreciate."</p><p>While we're only beginning to understand the functional consequences of all this complexity, it's safe to say that it allows networks composed of actual neurons far more flexibility in how they process information—a flexibility that may underly how these neurons get re-deployed in a way that these researchers identified as crucial for some form of generalized intelligence.</p><p>But the differences between neural networks and the real-world brains they were modeled on go well beyond the functional differences we've talked about so far. They extend to significant differences in how these functional units are organized.</p><p>The neural networks we've generated so far are largely specialized systems meant to handle a single task. Even the most complicated tasks, like the prediction of protein structures, have typically relied on the interaction of only two or three specialized systems. In contrast, the typical brain has alotof functional units. Some of these operate by sequentially processing a single set of inputs in something resembling a pipeline. But many others can operate in parallel, in some cases without any controlling activity going on elsewhere in the brain.</p><p>To give a sense of what this looks like, let's think about what's going on as you read this article. Doing so requires systems that handle motor control, which keep your head and eyes focused on the screen. Part of this system operates via feedback from the neurons that are processing the read material, causing small eye movements that help your eyes move across individual sentences and between lines.</p><p>Separately, there's part of your brain devoted to telling the visual system whatnotto pay attention to, like the icon showing an ever-growing number of unread emails. Those of us who can read a webpage without even noticing the ads on it presumably have a very well-developed system in place for ignoring things. Reading this article may also mean you're engaging the systems that handle other senses, getting you to ignore things like the noise of your heating system coming on while remaining alert for things that might signify threats, like an unexplained sound in the next room.</p><p>The input generated by the visual system then needs to be processed, from individual character recognition up to the identification of words and sentences, processes that involve systems in areas of the brain involved in both visual processing and language. Again, this is an iterative process, where building meaning from a sentence may require many eye movements to scan back and forth across a sentence, improving reading comprehension—and requiring many of these systems to communicate among themselves.</p><p>As meaning gets extracted from a sentence, other parts of the brain integrate it with information obtained in earlier sentences, which tends to engage yet another area of the brain, one that handles a short-term memory system called working memory. Meanwhile, other systems will be searching long-term memory, finding related material that can help the brain place the new information within the context of what it already knows. Still other specialized brain areas are checking for things like whether there's any emotional content to the material you're reading.</p><p>All of these different areas are engaged without you being consciously aware of the need for them.</p><p>In contrast, something like ChatGPT, despite having a lot of artificial neurons, is monolithic: No specialized structures are allocated before training starts. That's in sharp contrast to a brain. "The brain does not start out as a bag of neurons and then as a baby it needs to make sense of the world and then determine what connections to make," Baker noted. "There already a lot of constraints and specifics that are already set up."</p><p>Even in cases where it's not possible to see any physical distinction between cells specialized for different functions, Baker noted that we can often find differences in what genes are active.</p><p>In contrast, pre-planned modularity is relatively new to the AI world. In software development, "This concept of modularity is well established, so we have the whole methodology around it, how to manage it," Schain said, "it's really an aspect that is important for maybe achieving AI systems that can then operate similarly to the human brain." There are a few cases where developers have enforced modularity on systems, but Goldstein said these systems need to be trained with all the modules in place to see any gain in performance.</p><p>None of this is saying that a modular system can't arise within a neural network as a result of its training. But so far, we have very limited evidence that they do. And since we mostly deploy each system for a very limited number of tasks, there's no reason to think modularity will be valuable.</p><p>There is some reason to believe that this modularity is key to the brain's incredible flexibility. The region that recognizes emotion-evoking content in written text can also recognize it in music and images, for example. But the evidence here is mixed. There are some clear instances where a single brain region handles related tasks, but that's not consistently the case; Baker noted that, "When you're talking humans, there are parts of the brain that are dedicated to understanding speech, and there are different areas that are involved in producing speech."</p><p>This sort of re-use would also provide an advantage in terms of learning since behaviors developed in one context could potentially be deployed in others. But as we'll see, the differences between brains and AI when it comes to learning are far more comprehensive than that.</p><p>Current AIs generally have two states: training and deployment. Training is where the AI learns its behavior; deployment is where that behavior is put to use. This isn't absolute, as the behavior can be tweaked in response to things learned during deployment, like finding out it recommends eating a rock daily. But for the most part, once the weights among the connections of a neural network are determined through training, they're retained.</p><p>That may be starting to change a bit, Schain said. "There is now maybe a shift in similarity where AI systems are using more and more what they call the test time compute, where at inference time you do much more than before, kind of a parallel to how the human brain operates," he told Ars. But it's still the case that neural networks are essentially useless without an extended training period.</p><p>In contrast, a brain doesn't have distinct learning and active states; it's constantly in both modes. In many cases, the brain learnswhiledoing. Baker described that in terms of learning to take jumpshots: "Once you have made your movement, the ball has left your hand, it's going to land somewhere. So that visual signal—that comparison of where it landed versus where you wanted it to go—is what we call an error signal. That's detected by the cerebellum, and its goal is to minimize that error signal. So the next time you do it, the brain is trying to compensate for what you did last time."</p><p>It makes for very different learning curves. An AI is typically not very useful until it has had a substantial amount of training. In contrast, a human can often pick up basic competence in a very short amount of time (and without massive energy use). "Even if you're put into a situation where you've never been before, you can still figure it out," Baker said. "If you see a new object, you don't have to be trained on that a thousand times to know how to use it. A lot of the time, [if] you see it one time, you can make predictions."</p><p>As a result, while an AI system with sufficient training may ultimately outperform the human, the human will typically reach a high level of performance faster. And unlike an AI, a human's performance doesn't remain static. Incremental improvements and innovative approaches are both still possible. This also allows humans to adjust to changed circumstances more readily. An AI trained on the body of written material up until 2020 might struggle to comprehend teen-speak in 2030; humans could at least potentially adjust to the shifts in language. (Though maybe an AI trained to respond to confusing phrasing with "get off my lawn" would be indistinguishable.)</p><p>Finally, since the brain is a flexible learning device, the lessons learned from one skill can be applied to related skills. So the ability to recognize tones and read sheet music can help with the mastery of multiple musical instruments. Chemistry and cooking share overlapping skillsets. And when it comes to schooling, learning how to learn can be used to master a wide range of topics.</p><p>In contrast, it's essentially impossible to use an AI model trained on one topic for much else. The biggest exceptions are large language models, which seem to be able to solve problems on a wide variety of topics if they're presented as text. But here, there's still a dependence on sufficient examples of similar problems appearing in the body of text the system was trained on. To give an example, something like ChatGPT can seem to be able to solve math problems, but it's best at solving things that were discussed in its training materials; giving it something new will generally cause it to stumble.</p><p>For Schain, however, the biggest difference between AI and biology is in terms of memory. For many AIs, "memory" is indistinguishable from the computational resources that allow it to perform a task and the connections formed during training. For the large language models, it includes both the weights of connections learned then and a narrow "context window" that encompasses any recent exchanges with a single user. In contrast, biological systems have a lifetime of memories to rely on.</p><p>"For AI, it's very basic: It's like the memory is in the weights [of connections] or in the context. But with a human brain, it's a much more sophisticated mechanism, still to be uncovered. It's more distributed. There is the short term and long term, and it has to do a lot with different timescales. Memory for the last second, a minute, and a day or a year and years, and they all may be relevant."</p><p>This lifetime of memories can be key to making intelligence general. It helps us recognize the possibilities and limits of drawing analogies between different circumstances or applying things learned in one context versus another. It provides us with insights that let us solve problems that we've never confronted before. And, of course, it also ensures that the horrible bit of pop music you were exposed to in your teens remains an earworm well into your 80s.</p><p>The differences between how brains and AIs handle memory, however, are very hard to describe. AIs don't really have distinct memory, while the use of memory as the brain handles a task more sophisticated than navigating a maze is generally so poorly understood that it's difficult to discuss at all. All we can really say is that there are clear differences there.</p><p>It's difficult to think about AI without recognizing the enormous energy and computational resources involved in training one. And in this case, it's potentially relevant. Brains have evolved under enormous energy constraints and continue to operate using well under the energy that a daily diet can provide. That has forced biology to figure out ways to optimize its resources and get the most out of the ones it does commit to a task.</p><p>In contrast, the story of recent developments in AI is largely one of throwing more resources at them. And plans for the future seem to (so far at least) involve more of this, including larger training data sets and ever more artificial neurons and connections among them. All of this comes at a time when the best current AIs are already using three orders of magnitude more neurons than we'd find in a fly's brain and have nowhere near the fly's general capabilities.</p><p>It remains possible that there is more than one route to those general capabilities and that some offshoot of today's AI systems will eventually find a different route. But if it turns out that we have to bring our computerized systems closer to biology to get there, we'll run into a serious roadblock: We don't fully understand the biology yet.</p><p>"I guess I am not optimistic that any kind of artificial neural network will ever be able to achieve the same plasticity, the same generalizability, the same flexibility that a human brain has," Baker said. "That's just because we don't even know how it gets it; we don't know how that arises. So how do you build that into a system?"</p>

    <h1>Elon Musk fans truly believe he can make Dogecoin the currency of Earth</h1>

        <p>Dogecoin Foundation strikes deals to mainstream the popular memecoin.</p><p>At a time when many analysts are declaring memecoins dead, the most popular memecoin of all time, Dogecoin, not only perseveres but appears likely to become more mainstream than ever in 2025.</p><p>Most memecoins—cryptocurrencies inspired by Internet memes—remain controversial. Their prices can suddenly skyrocket before abruptly crashing, causing extreme gains and losses at a moment's notice, often triggered by a celebrity mention that tenuously amplifies short-term interest.</p><p>Donald Trump's memecoin is a recent example. Within two days of its launch, it peaked at above $70 before falling to $17 shortly after, Reutersreported. Seeing that politically backed token take off apparently inspired Argentine President Javier Milei to endorse another memecoin called Libra, which seemed to set off a brief price surge before a devastating crash that caused most traders to endure losses. Only about 34 investors in totalreportedlyprofited $124.6 million from Milei's endorsement, which a federal judge is now investigating as an alleged "rug pull" scheme, Reutersreported.</p><p>Overall, memecoins are viewed as highly volatile cryptocurrency assets vulnerable to fraud, insider trading, pump-and-dump schemes, and other market manipulation. And Dogecoin, like all memecoins, has also experienced wild swings in its value, which seems especially volatile before and after Elon Musk promotes the token on his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter).</p><p>Although Dogecoin started out as a joke cryptocurrency, investors started taking it more seriously after its value jumped by 36,000 percent after Musk tweets promised to send it "to the moon" in 2021, sociologist Dominik Zelinsky wrote in a 2024articleexploring Musk's influence on the Dogecoin market. And more recently, Dogecoin's price spiked after Donald Trump formally announced the creation of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE, a reference to the token).</p><p>Musk's X posts about Dogecoin are viewed as so dependable to move the market that hundreds have used a bot to instantly buy and sell the token on Binance based on what they say,Tradogecreator Guillaume Schurck told Ars (while also noting that he never offers any financial advice and is not a Musk fan).</p><p>In the past, Musk has said that "the most entertaining outcome"—and "the most ironic outcome"—of his efforts to popularize Dogecoin "would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth of the future." His seeming influence on Dogecoin's price has prompted at least one attempted class-action lawsuit raised by angry Dogecoin investors who accused Musk of running a "crypto pyramid scheme" that collectively caused $258 billion in losses by seemingly pumping up Dogecoin's price at his whim, Zelinsky noted.</p><p>Musk successfully defeated those claims, partly by insisting that his forward-looking statements about Dogecoin were purely "aspirational." But while the judge in that case said Musk's Dogecoin praise was obviously "puffery" that "no reasonable investor could rely upon," Zelinsky analyzed two years of Musk's social media posts trying to understand "why did people follow Musk" and spend "their money on an object that was never intended to be a sound investment?"</p><p>He found that years of Musk tweets branding Dogecoin as "the people's crypto" and envisioning the token as someday becoming "the standard for the global financial system" actually created a segment of true believers among his followers who, to this day, fully expect Musk to be a cryptocurrency kingmaker who will crown Dogecoin as the default "currency of Earth."  (It possibly helps that Musk hasrepeatedlyreferredto his supporters as the "people of Earth.")</p><p>Those true believers recently got a big boost of confidence that "someday" may be coming soon. Last week, Dogecoin Foundation Director Timothy Stebbingannouncedon X that deals have been struck with big brands to "rapidly" accelerate Dogecoin's adoption and utility.</p><p>"We believe 2025 will see the largest growth in utility and adoption to date," Stebbing predicted in a 2024 Dogecoin ecosystemreport.</p><p>But Dogecoin's plan hinges on stabilizing the memecoin's value, which is what Zelinsky found the segment of Musk believers also want. And that has seemingly introduced some tension in their belief system, should Musk's ongoing endorsements maintain the memecoin's price volatility and potentially obstruct Dogecoin's steady growth.</p><p>In his report, Stebbing wrote that Dogecoin could see between 200–300 percent growth in value over the next three years by partnering on "projects that see Dogecoin used as a means of payment for goods and services."</p><p>"The true value of Dogecoin will settle as we move from speculative asset to utility-based means of exchange," Stebbing forecasted, suggesting that by steering the token away from pump-and-dump cycles, "the future looks bright."</p><p>For Musk fans who expect him to make or break the memecoin, it may be hard to swallow that the best thing for Dogecoin could be for Musk to stop talking about it.</p><p>Stebbing told Ars that Musk "definitely got Dogecoin noticed," but "long before any celebrity endorsements, Dogecoin had a very active community" who used the coin to complete small transactions between individuals. It was initially useful for tipping or paying artists and musicians, he said. And if Musk stepped back from his 2019 fan-appointed role as Dogecoin's fake CEO, that might end up being the move that allows the memecoin to shine.</p><p>"As far as celebrity endorsements having an effect on the price, I know a lot of us would rather it stay a bit more stable, but since Dogecoin isn't supposed to be speculative, a celebrity 'pump' isn't that vital," Stebbing told Ars. "Acceptance and adoption, however, is."</p><p>Apparently, the ball got rolling on a series of deals after a mysterious "close friend of Dogecoin" introduced the foundation to "a group of people with decades of experience at the very top of the American private investment and enterprise world," Stebbing said on X. (As you might expect, some commenters made jokes implying Musk may be the "close friend.")</p><p>Unlike prior investors who only saw Dogecoin as a flashy brand with social media traction to cash in on, Stebbing claimed that this investor group—members of which will be made public by mid-March—simply "wanted to be involved in helping Dogecoin achieve [its] goals of becoming a real daily-use currency, through adoption for payments across the United States."</p><p>Springing from that partnership is a new commercial entity called the House of Doge (HOD), Stebbing confirmed. Over the next five years, the HOD will be "tasked with bringing Dogecoin adoption to the world stage," putting Dogecoin in the pockets of "large corporations, globally recognized brands, and millions of new individuals not yet familiar with Dogecoin and our mission," Stebbing wrote.</p><p>In his post, Stebbing paints a future in which Dogecoin is widely accepted at major sporting events—possibly catching on with millions of baseball, football, hockey, and sports-car racing fans who may never have traded in cryptocurrency before. The token will also be an acceptable form of payment at restaurant chains, Stebbing teased, and even potentially soon in kids' school cafeteria lines. And perhaps representing the strongest endorsement of Dogecoin's legitimacy as a currency, Stebbing said US government officials are also "excited" about adopting Dogecoin to pay for "everything from city parking" to utilities.</p><p>Previously, the Dogecoin Foundation operated on donations fueling a small development team, limiting the currency's growth, as Stebbing claimed the foundation turned away millions in potential investments deemed unserious about Dogecoin's mission. But now, with money soon coming from the HOD, the foundation is already moving to double its development team. That will allow the foundation to focus on building new technologies, making it even easier to adopt the memecoin in even more settings, Stebbing said.</p><p>The HOD will also "create a large Dogecoin Reserve & Treasury which will be utilized to provide liquidity to the various organizations and integrations across the US, to help onboard a whole new wave of users to Dogecoin," Stebbing wrote on X.</p><p>Not everyone believes Dogecoin is about to take over the world.</p><p>At the time of this writing, the token is worth approximately 20 cents after about a week of incremental price drops that—according to live reporting on blockchain transactions by"Whale_Alert"on X—areseemingly spookingsome traders.</p><p>That's not true of certain Dogecoin believers who endure slump after slump, firmly believing in the token's long-term vision and not seeking short-term gains or simply committing to the bit. And at the start of 2025, there was some evidence that their belief was well-founded. In December, Galaxy Research, which focuses on forecasting cryptocurrency trends,predictedthat Dogecoin could hit the $1 mark in 2025. Back in 2021 when Musk was helping pump up Dogecoin's price to its furthest extreme, Mark Cubanpredictedthat when the memecoin reached a $1 valuation, Dogecoin would likely stay above that price and function like a stablecoin.</p><p>Unlike memecoins, stablecoins' values are pegged to various currencies. In the US, for example, Trump has abandoned the idea of developing a central bank digital currency in favor of legislation promoting the mass adoption of US dollar-backed stablecoins. According to Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith—whose group is currently advising Congress on stablecoin legislation while forming small working groups to build industry consensus on policy shifts—the "whole point" ofTrump pushing stablecoinsis to strengthen the US dollar by speeding up and increasing access to it worldwide.</p><p>Smith told Ars that Trump's crypto czar, David Sacks (a longtime Musk ally), appears motivated to advance stablecoin legislation "as soon as possible this year."</p><p>Currently, there are two bills—the"STABLE" Actin the House and the"GENIUS" Actin the Senate (which, yes, if combined, could be billed as the "STABLE GENIUS" Act, Smith joked)—that provide both bank and non-bank paths to issue dollar-backed stablecoins.</p><p>The Blockchain Association advocated for non-bank paths for years, making it clear to lawmakers that demand is there.</p><p>"Globally, there's actually a huge demand for US dollar-denominated stablecoins because many countries are looking for a safe place to store their money, and they want to get access to US dollars, and they can't get it through their banks," Smith said. "And so they're getting it through stablecoins."</p><p>In the future, Smith wants to see state and federal pathways developed, as well as a market regulator appointed to officially classify tokens.</p><p>If done "correctly," clearer regulatory guidelines would encourage a wide range of companies to issue tokens from the US, Smith said, while potentially paving the way for the entire industry of blockchain technologies to thrive domestically. Mass adoption of stablecoins could also, she suggested, normalize and spur the adoption of other cryptocurrencies as average US citizens suddenly become used to having crypto wallets.</p><p>"I think stablecoins have the potential to be the gateway to the crypto world for a lot of Americans," Smith told Ars.</p><p>Marquette University finance expert David Krause told Ars that he agrees with Smith that "wider stablecoin adoption could pave the way for broader cryptocurrency acceptance, potentially including Dogecoin."</p><p>"Almost all memecoins are nothing more than a joke or a scam," Krause said. "However, Dogecoin's low fees and fast transaction times actually make it somewhat attractive for payments, like tipping or donating to charities. As Dogecoin's ecosystem expands with real-world applications (small retailer integration is possible), it could move beyond its meme status and become a more practical tool."</p><p>But Krause does not see a future in which Dogecoin could become a common medium of exchange.</p><p>"I certainly don't imagine using Dogecoin at the grocery store checkout," Krause told Ars.</p><p>This month, Krause published anarticlesuggesting that it was unlikely that the Securities and Exchange Commission would approve Dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—a verdict expected this October that could also help mainstream the memecoin or move it closer to the $1 mark.</p><p>Krause told Ars he believes that even with the Trump administration's rushed attempts to quickly relax crypto regulations, ETF approval would probably be a "long shot" because "Dogecoin's volatility and speculative nature present major hurdles" without "substantial safeguards and structural changes."</p><p>"Celebrity endorsements and social media hype might give Dogecoin a short-term boost, but this could actually harm its long-term viability," Krause told Ars. "Dogecoin's price volatility, driven by social media trends rather than underlying value, makes it susceptible to market manipulation and raises regulatory concerns. To thrive long-term, Dogecoin needs to shift its focus from hype to fundamental development, real-world applications, and regulatory compliance."</p><p>For his part, Stebbing told Ars that he doesn't see ETFs playing a long-term role in the Dogecoin landscape, and he isn't fixated on Dogecoin reaching $1. In fact, he's eager to move past the milestone, whether Dogecoin sticks at that vaunted price point or not.</p><p>"Price stability is more important than price when it comes to using Dogecoin for everyday retail purchases," Stebbing told Ars. "If I had to guess, there are a lot of people who will sell their Dogecoin the moment we hit $1, [and] I look forward to getting that over with so we can find the true, stable value of the currency."</p><p>Smith pointed out that stablecoin legislation could motivate companies to become stablecoin issuers, and it seems likely that Musk would entertain such an idea on X, where his attempts to launch X Money have stalled so far.</p><p>After claiming thatX users could manage their entire financial lifeon the platform by the end of 2024, Musk's platform kicked off 2025 heavily promoting X Money's delayed launch this year. Those announcements came despite the fact thatX withdrew a key money transmitter license application in New Yorkthat analysts suggested risked delaying its launch indefinitely.</p><p>It seems possible that stablecoins could provide X with another path to issue dollar-backed currency without needing money transmitter licenses in every state. Musk may have given up on fighting for the licenses, instead teaming up with Trump to potentially eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which monitors the traditional sort of money transmitter activities that currently seem just out of Musk's reach. (Trump killing off the CFPB is viewed as a conflict of interest for Musk, whose DOGE department is overseeing cuts, CBS Newsreported.)</p><p>There has long been speculation that X Money will enable cryptocurrency payments, including Dogecoin. After Musk took over Twitter, he briefly changed the logo to a shiba inu, the symbol of Dogecoin. And while X has never officially confirmed the rumors, it's not a stretch to think that Musk may be interested in promoting Dogecoin through X, perhaps even striving to make it easier to convert Dogecoin into stablecoins on the same platform where Musk's posts, many followers believe, move markets.</p><p>If X embraces Dogecoin, it could make bots like Tradoge less attractive. Schurck told Ars that changes Musk made removing free access to X's API had already briefly disrupted the bot, but he "managed to find a workaround."</p><p>Stebbing told Ars that he has no "special insight" into Musk's plans for X Money, but he thinks "it would be unusual, considering their predilections as an organization that once had the Dogecoin mascot as their logo for a week, not to adopt the currency."</p><p>"Time will tell," Stebbing said.</p><p>X did not respond to Ars' request to comment.</p><p>Schurck told Ars he's not really involved in trading any cryptocurrencies other than Dogecoin, confirming that, like many others Zelinsky tracked online, he primarily became attracted to the memecoin because of Musk's endorsements.</p><p>"Musk's X posting is the main reason I buy and sell Doge," Schurck said.</p><p>Of course, Schurck isn’t alone in only trading Dogecoin due to Musk's influence.</p><p>Zelinsky started studying Musk's seeming power over Dogecoin markets while filling a gap in research exploring economic impacts of charismatic leaders like Musk and Trump, whose authority is "made, maintained, and unmade through symbolically charged acts of social exchange." He's currently writing a book focused on expanding research into how charismatic leaders in the tech world and other areas are changing over time and considers Musk "a pretty good example" of a charismatic leader whose political influence is currently peaking.</p><p>"It's hard to go higher than being this kind of a second-in-charge or second-in-popularity to Trump," Zelinsky said.</p><p>On Reddit and X, Zelinsky analyzed messages from Musk followers who truly believed that Dogecoin price hikes are Musk's "gift" propelling Dogecoin to become not just the "currency of Earth" but the currency of Mars. That's the real fantasy that makes Musk such a charismatic figure, Zelinsky suggested.</p><p>"If we keep believing in the coin and everything we should make it stand for, we will be chilling on Mars," one Musk follower said.</p><p>"Forget about the effing moon, Elon Musk is taking Doge to Mars!!!" another posted.</p><p>Others, whom Zelinsky satirically refers to as pirates, are more pragmatic. In a "non-devotional way," Zelinsky told Ars, they trust that Musk "could create a momentous demand that would drive the price of Dogecoin upward and let them profit from credulous investors who are late to the party."</p><p>"I used Doge the right way," one Musk follower said. "I’m not gonna hold that shit," it "has no utility. Just have notifications turned on for [Elon's] twits and [make] some easy money."</p><p>Zelinsky told Ars that historically, followers of charismatic leaders generally hold onto their beliefs until the charisma wanes and figures become viewed as mundane. Since Musk's political influence is arguably greater than ever, it's likely that his followers have only strengthened their belief in his power to fulfill his promises to popularize Dogecoin and take them to Mars.</p><p>But charismatic authority is "a very volatile kind of phenomenon," Zelinsky said, forecasting that even Musk "cannot stay charismatic forever." He pointed to a field of study into technofeudalism, which theorizes that tech leaders in particular are becoming more traditional and less disruptive over time.</p><p>One could argue that Dogecoin, too, has charismatic authority over traders, many of whom love that Doge is disruptive and buy Doge just for a laugh. But if Dogecoin becomes more stable, as Stebbing wants, Dogecoin risks becoming "less interesting as an object of belief," Zelinsky suggested.</p><p>And although there are plenty of believers in Dogecoin today, there also persists a stubborn segment of Dogecoin fans who don't want the joke to end or see the memecoin become as normal as a crumpled-up dollar. Dogecoin could risk losing this joker segment if it becomes too stable and serious.</p><p>Schurck told Ars that while he could easily see more people using Dogecoin if companies started adopting it as a payment method, for him, "Dogecoin remains a joke first. A funny, expensive joke and a cool meme, sure! But still a joke."</p>

    <h1>Why Anthropic’s Claude still hasn’t beaten Pokémon</h1>

        <p>Weeks later, Sonnet's "reasoning" model is struggling with a game designed for children.</p><p>In recent months, the AI industry's biggest boosters have started converging on a public expectation that we'reon the verge of “artificial general intelligence”(AGI)—virtual agents that can match or surpass "human-level" understanding and performance on most cognitive tasks.</p><p>OpenAI isquietly seeding expectations for a "PhD-level" AI agentthat could operate autonomously at the level of a "high-income knowledge worker" in the near future. Elon Musksaysthat "we'll have AI smarter than any one human probably" by the end of 2025. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei thinks it might take a bit longer but similarlysaysit's plausible that AI will be "better than humans at almost everything" by the end of 2027.</p><p>Last month, Anthropic presented its “Claude Plays Pokémon” experiment as a waypoint on the road to that predicted AGI future. It's a project the companysaidshows "glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning." Anthropic made headlines bytrumpetinghow Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s "improved reasoning capabilities" let the company's latest model make progress in the popular old-school Game Boy RPG in ways "that older models had little hope of achieving."</p><p>While Claude models from just a year ago struggled even to leave the game’s opening area, Claude 3.7 Sonnet was able to make progress by collecting multiple in-game Gym Badges in a relatively small number of in-game actions. That breakthrough, Anthropic wrote, was because the “extended thinking” by Claude 3.7 Sonnet means the new model "plans ahead, remembers its objectives, and adapts when initial strategies fail" in a way that its predecessors didn’t. Those things, Anthropic brags, are "critical skills for battling pixelated gym leaders. And, we posit, in solving real-world problems too."</p><p>But relative success over previous models is not the same as absolute success over the game in its entirety. In the weeks since Claude Plays Pokémon was first made public,thousands of Twitch viewershave watched Claude struggle to make consistent progress in the game. Despite long "thinking" pauses between each move—during which viewers can read printouts of the system’s simulated reasoning process—Claude frequently finds itself pointlessly revisiting completed towns, getting stuck in blind corners of the map for extended periods, or fruitlessly talking to the same unhelpful NPC over and over, to cite just a few examples of distinctly sub-human in-game performance.</p><p>Watching Claude continue to struggle at a game designed for children, it’s hard to imagine we’re witnessing the genesis of some sort of computer superintelligence. But even Claude’s current sub-human level of Pokémon performance could hold significant lessons for the quest toward generalized, human-level artificial intelligence.</p><p>In some sense, it’s impressive that Claude can play Pokémon with any facility at all. When developing AI systems that find dominant strategies in games likeGoandDota 2, engineers generally start their algorithms off with deep knowledge of a game’s rules and/or basic strategies, as well as a reward function to guide them toward better performance. For Claude Plays Pokémon, though, project developer and Anthropic employee David Hershey says he started with an unmodified, generalized Claude model that wasn’t specifically trained or tuned to play Pokémon games in any way.</p><p>“This is purely the various other things that [Claude] understands about the world being used to point at video games,” Hershey told Ars. “So it has a sense of a Pokémon. If you go to claude.ai and ask about Pokémon, it knows what Pokémon is based on what it's read… If you ask, it'll tell you there's eight gym badges, it'll tell you the first one is Brock… it knows the broad structure.”</p><p>In addition to directly monitoring certain key (emulated) Game Boy RAM addresses for game state information, Claude views and interprets the game's visual output much like a human would. But despiterecent advances in AI image processing, Hershey said Claude still struggles to interpret the low-resolution, pixelated world of a Game Boy screenshot as well as a human can. “Claude's still not particularly good at understanding what's on the screen at all,” he said. “You will see it attempt to walk into walls all the time.”</p><p>Hershey said he suspects Claude’s training data probably doesn’t contain many overly detailed text descriptions of “stuff that looks like a Game Boy screen.” This means that, somewhat surprisingly, if Claude were playing a game with “more realistic imagery, I think Claude would actually be able to see a lot better,” Hershey said.</p><p>“It's one of those funny things about humans that we can squint at these eight-by-eight pixel blobs of people and say, ‘That's a girl with blue hair,’” Hershey continued. “People, I think, have that ability to map from our real world to understand and sort of grok that... so I'm honestly kind of surprised that Claude's as good as it is at being able to see there's a person on the screen.”</p><p>Even with a perfect understanding of what it’s seeing on-screen, though, Hershey said Claude would still struggle with 2D navigation challenges that would be trivial for a human. “It’s pretty easy for me to understand that [an in-game] building is a building and that I can’t walk through a building,” Hershey said. “And that's [something] that's pretty challenging for Claude to understand… It's funny because it's just kind of smart in different ways, you know?”</p><p>Where Claude tends to perform better, Hershey said, is in the more text-based portions of the game. During an in-game battle, Claude will readily notice when the game tells it that an attack from an electric-type Pokémon is “not very effective” against a rock-type opponent, for instance. Claude will then squirrel that factoid away in a massive written knowledge base for future reference later in the run. Claude can also integrate multiple pieces of similar knowledge into pretty elegant battle strategies, even extending those strategies into long-term plans for catching and managing teams of multiple creatures for future battles.</p><p>Claude can even show surprising “intelligence” when Pokémon’s in-game text is intentionally misleading or incomplete. “It's pretty funny that they tell you you need to go find Professor Oak next door and then he's not there,” Hershey said of an early-game task. “As a 5-year-old, that was very confusing to me. But Claude actually typically goes through that same set of motions where it talks to mom, goes to the lab, doesn't find [Oak], says, ‘I need to figure something out’… It's sophisticated enough to sort of go through the motions of the way [humans are] actually supposed to learn it, too.”</p><p>These kinds of relative strengths and weaknesses when compared to “human-level” play reflect the overall state of AI research and capabilities in general, Hershey said. “I think it's just a sort of universal thing about these models... We built the text side of it first, and the text side is definitely... more powerful. How these models can reason about images is getting better, but I think it's a decent bit behind.”</p><p>Beyond issues parsing text and images, Hershey also acknowledged that Claude can have trouble “remembering” what it has already learned. The current model has a “context window” of 200,000 tokens, limiting the amount of relational information it can store in its “memory” at any one time. When the system’s ever-expanding knowledge base fills up this context window, Claude goes through an elaborate summarization process, condensing detailed notes on what it has seen, done, and learned so far into shorter text summaries that lose some of the fine-grained details.</p><p>This can mean that Claude “has a hard time keeping track of things for a very long time and really having a great sense of what it's tried so far,” Hershey said. “You will definitely see it occasionally delete something that it shouldn't have. Anything that's not in your knowledge base or not in your summary is going to be gone, so you have to think about what you want to put there.”</p><p>More than forgetting important history, though, Claude runs into bigger problems when it inadvertently inserts incorrect information into its knowledge base. Like a conspiracy theorist who builds an entire worldview from an inherently flawed premise, Claude can be incredibly slow to recognize when an error in its self-authored knowledge base is leading its Pokémon play astray.</p><p>“The things that are written down in the past, it sort of trusts pretty blindly,” Hershey said. “I have seen it become very convinced that it found the exit to [in-game location] Viridian Forest at some specific coordinates, and then it spends hours and hours exploring a little small square around those coordinates that are wrong instead of doing anything else. It takes a very long time for it to decide that that was a ‘fail.’”</p><p>Still, Hershey said Claude 3.7 Sonnet is much better than earlier models at eventually “questioning its assumptions, trying new strategies, and keeping track over long horizons of various strategies to [see] whether they work or not.” While the new model will still “struggle for really long periods of time” retrying the same thing over and over, it will ultimately tend to “get a sense of what's going on and what it’s tried before, and it stumbles a lot of times into actual progress from that,” Hershey said.</p><p>One of the most interesting things about observing Claude Plays Pokémon across multiple iterations and restarts, Hershey said, is seeing how the system’s progress and strategy can vary quite a bit between runs. Sometimes Claude will show it's “capable of actually building a pretty coherent strategy” by “keeping detailed notes about the different paths to try,” for instance, he said. But “most of the time it doesn't… most of the time, it wanders into the wall because it's confident it sees the exit.”</p><p>One of the biggest things preventing the current version of Claude from getting better, Hershey said, is that “when it derives that good strategy, I don't think it necessarily has the self-awareness to know that one strategy [it] came up with is better than another.” And that’s not a trivial problem to solve.</p><p>Still, Hershey said he sees “low-hanging fruit” for improving Claude’s Pokémon play by improving the model’s understanding of Game Boy screenshots. “I think there's a chance it could beat the game if it had a perfect sense of what's on the screen,” Hershey said, saying that such a model would probably perform “a little bit short of human.”</p><p>Expanding the context window for future Claude models will also probably allow those models to “reason over longer time frames and handle things more coherently over a long period of time,” Hershey said. Future models will improve by getting “a little bit better at remembering, keeping track of a coherent set of what it needs to try to make progress,” he added.</p><p>Whatever you think about impending improvements in AI models, though, Claude’s current performance at Pokémon doesn’t make it seem like it’s poised to usher in an explosion of human-level, completely generalizable artificial intelligence. And Hershey allows that watching Claude 3.7 Sonnet get stuck on Mt. Moon for 80 hours or so can make it “seem like a model that doesn't know what it's doing.”</p><p>But Hershey is still impressed at the way that Claude's new reasoning model will occasionally show some glimmer of awareness and “kind of tell that it doesn't know what it's doing and know that it needs to be doing something different. And the difference between ‘can't do it at all’ and ‘can kind of do it’ is a pretty big one for these AI things for me,” he continued. “You know, when something can kind of do something it typically means we're pretty close to getting it to be able to do something really, really well.”</p>

    <h1>Scoop: Origami measuring spoon incites fury after 9 years of Kickstarter delay hell</h1>

        <p>The curious case of the missing Kickstarter spoons.</p><p>An attention-grabbing Kickstartercampaignattempting to reinvent the measuring spoon has turned into a mad, mad, mad, mad world for backers after years of broken promises and thousands of missing spoons.</p><p>The mind-boggling design for the measuring spoon first wowed the Internet in 2016 after avideopromoting the Kickstarter campaign went viral and spawned widespread media coverage fawning over the unique design.</p><p>Known asPolygons, the three-in-one origami measuring spoons have a flat design that can be easily folded into common teaspoon and tablespoon measurements. "Regular spoons are so 3000 BC," a tagline on the project's website joked.</p><p>For gadget geeks, it's a neat example of thinking outside of the box, and fans found it appealing to potentially replace a drawer full of spoons with a more futuristic-looking compact tool. Most backers signed up for a single set, paying $8–$12 each, while hundreds wanted up to 25 sets, a handful ordered 50, and just one backer signed up for 100. Delivery was initially promised by 2017, supposedly shipping to anywhere in the world.</p><p>But it's been about nine years since more than 30,000 backers flocked to the Kickstarter campaign—raising more than $1 million and eclipsing Polygons' $10,000 goal. And not only have more than a third of the backers not received their spoons, but now, after years of updates claiming that the spoons had been shipped, some backers began to wonder if the entire campaign might be a fraud. They could see that Polygons are currently being sold on social media and suspected that the maker might be abusing backers' funds to chase profits, seemingly without ever seriously intending to fulfill their orders.</p><p>One Kickstarter backer, Caskey Hunsader, told Ars that he started doubting if the spoon's designer—an inventor from India, Rahul Agarwal—was even a real person.</p><p>Ars reached out to verify Agarwal's design background. We confirmed that, yes, Agarwal is a real designer, and, yes, he believes there is a method to the madness when it comes to his Kickstarter campaign, which he said was never intended to be a scam or fraud and is currently shipping spoons to backers. He forecasted that 2025 is likely the year that backers' wait will finally end.</p><p>But as thousands of complaints on the Kickstarter attest, backers have heard that one before. It's been two years since the last official update was posted, which only promised updates that never came and did not confirm that shipments were back on track. The prior update in 2022 promised that "the time has finally arrived when we begin bulk shipping to everyone!"</p><p>Hunsader told Ars that people seem mostly upset because of "bullshit," which is widely referenced in the comments. And that anger is compounded "by the fact that they are producing, and they are selling this product, so they are operating their business using funds that all these people who were their first backers gave them, and we're the ones who are not getting the product. I think that's where the anger comes from."</p><p>"It's been years now, and [I've] watched as you promise good people their products and never deliver," one commenter wrote. "Wherever you try... to sell [your] products, we will be there reminding them of the empty orders you left here."</p><p>"Where is my item? I am beyond angry," another fumed.</p><p>Those who did receive their spoons often comment on the substantial delays, but reviews are largely positive.</p><p>"Holy crap, folks," a somewhat satisfied backer wrote. "Hell has frozen over. I finally got them (no BS)."</p><p>One backer was surprised to get twice as many spoons as expected, referencing an explanation blaming Chinese New Year for one delay and writing, "I can honestly say after 8 years... and an enormous amount of emails, I finally received my pledge. Except... I only ordered 3... and I received 6. I'd be inclined to ship some back to Polygons... bare with me... I'll return them soon... I appreciate your patience... mebbe after Chinese New Years 2033..."</p><p>Agarwal agreed to meet with Ars, show us the spoon, and explain why backers still haven't gotten their deliveries when the spoon appears widely available to purchase online.</p><p>As a designer, Agarwal is clearly a perfectionist. He was just a student when he had the idea for Polygons in 2014, winning design awards and garnering interest that encouraged him to find a way to manufacture the spoons. He felt eager to see people using them.</p><p>Agarwal told Ars that before he launched the Kickstarter, he had prototypes made in China that were about 85 percent of the quality that he and his collaborators at InventIndia required. Anticipating that the quality would be fully there soon, Agarwal launched the Kickstarter, along with marketing efforts that Agarwal said had to be squashed due to unexpectedly high interest in the spoons.</p><p>This is when things started spiraling, as Agarwal had to switch manufacturers five times, with each partner crashing into new walls trying to execute the novel product.</p><p>Once the Kickstarter hit a million dollars, though, Agarwal committed to following through on launching the product. Eventually, cheap knockoff versions began appearing online on major retail sites like Walmart and Amazon toward the end of 2024. Because Agarwal has patents and trademarks for his design, he can get the knockoffs taken down, but they proved an important point that Agarwal had learned the hard way: that his design, while appearing simplistic, was incredibly hard to pull off.</p><p>Ars handled both a legitimate Polygons spoon and a cheap knockoff. The knockoff was a flimsy, unusable slab of rubber dotted with magnets; the companies aping Agarwal's idea are seemingly unable to replicate the manufacturing process that Agarwal has spent years perfecting to finally be able to widely ship Polygons today.</p><p>On the other hand, Agarwal's spoon is sturdy, uses food-grade materials, and worked just as well measuring wet and dry ingredients during an Ars test. A silicon hinge connects 19 separate plastic pieces and ensures that magnets neatly snap along indented lines indicating if the measurement is a quarter, half, or whole teaspoon or tablespoon. It took Agarwal two and a half years to finalize the design while working with InventIndia, a leading product development firm in India. Prototyping required making special molds that took a month each to iterate rather than using a 3D-printing shortcut whereby multiple prototypes could be made in a day, which Agarwal said he'd initially anticipated could be possible.</p><p>Around the time that the prototyping process concluded, Agarwal noted, COVID hit, and supply chains were disrupted, causing production setbacks. Once production could resume, costs became a factor, as estimates used to set Kickstarter backer awards were based on the early failed Chinese prototype, and the costs of producing a functioning spoon were much higher. Over time, shipping costs also rose.</p><p>As Kickstarter funds dwindled, there was no going back, so Agarwal devised a plan to sell the spoons for double the price ($25–$30 a set) by marketing them on social media, explaining this in anote to backersposted on the Polygons site. Those sales would fund ongoing manufacturing, allowing profits to be recycled so that Kickstarter backers could gradually receive shipments dependent on social media sales volumes. Orders from anyone who paid extra for expedited shipping are prioritized.</p><p>It's a math problem at this point, with more funding needed to scale. But Agarwal told Ars that sales on Shopify and TikTok Shop have increased each quarter, most recently selling 30,000 units on TikTok, which allowed Polygons to take out a bigger line of credit to fund more manufacturing. He also brought in a more experienced partner to focus on the business side while he optimizes production.</p><p>Agarwal told Ars that he understands trust has been broken with many Kickstarter backers, considering that totally fair. While about 38 percent of backers' orders still need filling, he predicts that all backers could get their orders within the next six to eight months as Polygons becomes better resourced, but that still depends on social media sales.</p><p>Agarwal met Ars after attending a housewares show in Chicago, where he shopped the spoons with retailers who may also help scale the product in the coming years. He anticipates that as the business scales, the cost of the spoons will come back down. And he may even be able to move onto executing other product designs that have been on the backburner as he attempts to work his way out of the Kickstarter corner he backed himself into while obsessing over his first design.</p><p>Hunsader told Ars there's a big difference "in a lie versus bad management," suggesting that as a business owner who has managed Kickstarter campaigns, he thinks more transparency likely could've spared Polygons a lot of angry comments.</p><p>"I am not sitting here with a dart board with [Agarwal's] face on it, being like, when am I going to get my damn spoons?" Hunsader joked. But the campaign's Kickstarter messaging left many backers feeling like Polygons took backers' money and ran, Hunsader said.</p><p>Unlike people who saw the spoons going viral on social media, Hunsader discovered Polygons just by scrolling on Kickstarter. As a fan of geeky gadgets, he used to regularly support campaigns, but his experience supporting Polygons and monitoring other cases of problematic Kickstarters have made him more hesitant to use the platform without more safeguards for backers.</p><p>"It's not specifically a Polygons problem," Hunsader told Ars. "The whole Kickstarter thing needs maybe just more protections in place."</p><p>Kickstarter did not respond to Ars' request to comment. But Kickstarter's "accountability"policymakes clear that creators "put their reputation at risk" launching campaigns and are ultimately responsible for following through on backer promises. Kickstarterdoesn't issue refundsorguarantee projects, only providinglimited supportwhen backers report "suspicious activity."</p><p>Redditors haveflagged "shitty" Kickstarter campaignssince 2012, three years after the site's founding, and the National Association of Attorneys General—which represents US state attorneys general—suggestedin 2019 that disgruntled crowdfunding backers were increasingly turning to consumer protection laws to fight alleged fraud.</p><p>In 2015, an independentanalysisby the University of Pennsylvania estimated that 9 percent of Kickstarter projects didn't fulfill their rewards. More recently, it appeared that figure had doubled, as Fortunereportedlast year that an internal Kickstarter estimate put "the amount of revenue that comes from fraudulent projects as high as 18 percent." A spokesperson disputed that estimate and told Fortune that the platform employs "extensive" measures to detect fraud.</p><p>Agarwal told Ars that he thinks it's uncommon for a campaign to continue fulfilling backer rewards after eight years of setbacks. It would be easier to just shut down and walk away, and Kickstarter likely would not have penalized him for it. While the Kickstarter campaign allowed him to reach his dream of seeing people using his novel measuring spoon in the real world, it's been bittersweet that the campaign has dragged out so long and kept the spoons out of the hands of his earliest supporters, he told Ars.</p><p>Hunsader told Ars that he hopes the Polygons story serves as a "cautionary tale" for both backers and creators who bite off more than they can chew when launching a Kickstarter campaign. He knows that designers like Agarwal can take a reputational hit.</p><p>"I don't want to make somebody who has big dreams not want to dream, but you also, when you're dealing with things like manufacturing technology, have to be realistic about what is and is not accomplishable," Hunsader said.</p><p>Polygons collaborators at InventIndia told Ars that Agarwal is "dedicated and hard-working," describing him as "someone deeply committed to delivering a product that meets the highest standards" and whose intentions have "always" been to "ship a perfect product."</p><p>Agarwal's team connected with Hunsader to schedule his Kickstarter reward shipment on Friday. Hunsader told Ars he doesn't really care if it takes another nine years. It's just a spoon, and "there are bigger fish to fry."</p><p>"Listen, I can buy that narrative that he was somebody who got totally overwhelmed but handled it in the worst possible way ever," Hunsader said.</p><p>He plans to continue patiently waiting for his spoons.</p><p>This story was updated on March 14 to update information on the Polygons Kickstarter campaign.</p>

    <h1>iPhone 16e review: The most expensive cheap iPhone yet</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Ars Technica</span>
        <span class="date">March 07, 2025</span>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>The iPhone 16e rethinks—and prices up—the basic iPhone.</p><p>For a long time, the cheapest iPhones were basically just iPhones that were older than the current flagship, but last week’s release of the $600 iPhone 16e marks a big change in how Apple is approaching its lineup.</p><p>Rather than a repackaging of an old iPhone, the 16e is the latest main iPhone—that is, theiPhone 16—with a bunch of stuff stripped away.</p><p>There are several potential advantages to this change. In theory, it allows Apple to support its lower-end offerings for longer with software updates, and it gives entry-level buyers access to more current technologies and features. It also simplifies the marketplace of accessories and the like.</p><p>There’s bad news, too, though: Since it replaces the much cheaperiPhone SEin Apple’s lineup, the iPhone 16e significantly raises the financial barrier to entry for iOS (the SE started at $430).</p><p>We spent a few days trying out the 16e and found that it’s a good phone—it’s just too bad it’s a little more expensive than the entry-level iPhone should ideally be. In many ways, this phone solves more problems for Apple than it does for consumers. Let’s explore why.</p><p>Like the 16, the 16e has Apple’s A18 chip, the most recent in the made-for-iPhone line of Apple-designed chips. There’s only one notable difference: This variation of the A18 has just four GPU cores instead of five. That will show up in benchmarks and in a handful of 3D games, but it shouldn’t make too much of a difference for most people.</p><p>It’s a significant step up over the A15 found in the final 2022 refresh of the iPhone SE, enabling a handful of new features like AAA games and Apple Intelligence.</p><p>The A18’s inclusion is good for both Apple and the consumer; Apple gets to establish a new, higher baseline of performance when developing new features for current and future handsets, and consumers likely get many more years of software updates than they’d get on the older chip.</p><p>The key example of a feature enabled by the A18 that Apple would probably like us all to talk about the most is Apple Intelligence, a suite of features utilizing generative AI to solve some user problems or enable new capabilities across iOS. By enabling these for the cheapest iPhone, Apple is making its messaging around Apple Intelligence a lot easier; it no longer needs to put effort into clarifying that you can use X feature with this new iPhone but not that one.</p><p>We’ve written a lotabout Apple Intelligence already, but here’s the gist: There are some useful features here in theory, but Apple’s models are clearly a bit behind the cutting edge, and results for things like notifications summaries or writing tools are pretty mixed. It’s fun to generate original emojis, though!</p><p>The iPhone 16e can even use Visual Intelligence, which actually is handy sometimes. On my iPhone 16 Pro Max, I can point the rear camera at an object and press the camera button a certain way to get information about it.</p><p>I wouldn’t have expected the 16e to support this, but it does, via the Action Button (which was first introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro). This is a reprogrammable button that can perform a variety of functions, albeit just one at a time. Visual Intelligence is one of the options here, which is pretty cool, even though it’s not essential.</p><p>Also like the 16, the 16e has a 6.1-inch display. The resolution’s a bit different, though; it's 2,532 by 1,170 pixels instead of 2,556 by 1,179. It also has a notch instead of the Dynamic Island seen in the 16. All this makes the iPhone 16e’s display seem like a very close match to the one seen in 2022’s iPhone 14—in fact, it might literally be the same display.</p><p>I really missed the Dynamic Island while using the iPhone 16e—it’s one of my favorite new features added to the iPhone in recent years, as it consolidates what was previously a mess of notification schemes in iOS. Plus, it’s nice to see things like Uber and DoorDash ETAs and sports scores at a glance.</p><p>The main problem with losing the Dynamic Island is that we’re back to the old minor mess of notifications approaches, and I guess Apple has to keep supporting the old ways for a while yet. That genuinely surprises me; I would have thought Apple would want to unify notifications and activities with the Dynamic Island just like the A18 allows the standardization of other features.</p><p>This seems to indicate that the Dynamic Island is a fair bit more expensive to include than the good old camera notch flagship iPhones had been rocking since 2017’s iPhone X.</p><p>That compromise aside, the display on the iPhone 16e is ridiculously good for a phone at this price point, and it makes the old iPhone SE’s small LCD display look like it’s from another eon entirely by comparison. It gets brighter for both HDR content and sunny-day operation; the blacks are inky and deep, and the contrast and colors are outstanding.</p><p>It’s the best thing about the iPhone 16e, even if it isn’t quite as refined as the screens in Apple’s current flagships. Most people would never notice the difference between the screens in the 16e and the iPhone 16 Pro, though.</p><p>There is one other screen feature I miss from the higher-end iPhones you can buy in 2025: Those phones can drop the display all the way down to 1 nit, which is awesome for using the phone late at night in bed without disturbing a sleeping partner. Like earlier iPhones, the 16e can only get so dark.</p><p>It gets quite bright, though; Apple claims it typically reaches 800 nits in peak brightness but that it can stretch to 1200 when viewing certain HDR photos and videos. That means it gets about twice as bright as the SE did.</p><p>The iPhone 16e supports the core suite of connectivity options found in modern phones. There’s Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, and Apple’s usual limited implementation of NFC.</p><p>There are three new things of note here, though, and they’re good, neutral, and bad, respectively.</p><p>Let’s start with the good. We’ve moved from Apple’s proprietary Lightning port found in older iPhones (including the final iPhone SE) toward USB-C, now a near-universal standard on mobile devices. It allows faster charging and more standardized charging cable support.</p><p>Sure, it’s a bummer to start over if you’ve spent years buying Lightning accessories, but it’s absolutely worth it in the long run. This change means that the entire iPhone line has now abandoned Lightning, so all iPhones and Android phones will have the same main port for years to come. Finally!</p><p>The finality of this shift solves a few problems for Apple: It greatly simplifies the accessory landscape and allows the company to move toward producing a smaller range of cables.</p><p>Recent flagship iPhones have gradually added a small suite of features that utilize satellite connectivity to make life a little easier and safer.</p><p>Among those is crash detection and roadside assistance. The former will use the sensors in the phone to detect if you’ve been in a car crash and contact help, and roadside assistance allows you to text for help when you’re outside of cellular reception in the US and UK.</p><p>There are also Emergency SOS and Find My via satellite, which let you communicate with emergency responders from remote places and allow you to be found.</p><p>Along with a more general feature that allows Messages via satellite, these features can greatly expand your options if you’re somewhere remote, though they’re not as easy to use and responsive as using the regular cellular network.</p><p>I don’t expect the 16e to have all the same features as the 16, which is $200 more expensive. In fact, it has more modern features than I think most of its target audience needs (more on that later). That said, there’s one notable omission that makes no sense to me at all.</p><p>The 16e does not support MagSafe, a standard for connecting accessories to the back of the device magnetically, often while allowing wireless charging via the Qi standard.</p><p>Qi wireless charging is still supported, albeit at a slow 7.5 W, but there are no magnets, meaning a lot of existing MagSafe accessories are a lot less useful with this phone, if they’re usable at all. To be fair, the SE didn’t support MagSafe either, but every new iPhone design since the iPhone 12 way back in 2020 has—and not just the premium flagships.</p><p>It’s not like the MagSafe accessory ecosystem was some bottomless well of innovation, but that magnetic alignment is handier than you might think, whether we’re talking about making sure the phone locks into place for the fastest wireless charging speeds or hanging the phone on a car dashboard to use GPS on the go.</p><p>It’s one of those things where folks coming from much older iPhones may not care because they don’t know what they’re missing, but it could be annoying in households with multiple generations of iPhones, and it justdoesn’t make any sense.</p><p>Most of Apple’s choices in the 16e seem to serve the goal of unifying the whole iPhone lineup to simplify the message for consumers and make things easier for Apple to manage efficiently, but the dropping of MagSafe is bizarre.</p><p>It almost makes me think that Apple might plan to drop MagSafe from future flagship iPhones, too, and go toward something new, just because that’s the only explanation I can think of. That otherwise seems unlikely to me right now, but I guess we’ll see.</p><p>We’ve been seeing rumors that Apple planned to drop third-party modems from companies like Qualcomm for years. As far back as 2018, Apple was poaching Qualcomm employees in an adjacent office in San Diego. In 2020, Apple SVP Johny Srouji announced to employees that work had begun.</p><p>It sounds like development has been challenging, but the first Apple-designed modem has arrived here in the 16e of all places. Dubbed the C1, it’s… perfectly adequate. It’s about as fast or maybe just a smidge slower than what you get in the flagship phones, but almost no user would notice any difference at all.</p><p>That’s really a win for Apple, which has struggled with a tumultuous relationship with its partners here for years and which has long run into space problems in its phones in part because the third-party modems weren’t compact enough.</p><p>This change may not matter much for the consumer beyond freeing up just a tiny bit of space for a slightly larger battery, but it’s another step in Apple’s long journey to ultimately and fully control every component in the iPhone that it possibly can.</p><p>There is one area where the 16e is actually superior to the 16, much less the SE: battery life. The 16e reportedly has a 3,961 mAh battery, the largest in any of the many iPhones with roughly this size screen. Apple says it offers up to 26 hours of video playback, which is the kind of number you expect to see in a much larger flagship phone.</p><p>I charged this phone three times in just under a week with it, though I wasn’t heavily hitting 5G networks, playing many 3D games, or cranking the brightness way up all the time while using it.</p><p>That’s a bit of a bump over the 16, but it’s a massive leap over the SE, which promised a measly 15 hours of video playback. Every single phone in Apple’s lineup now has excellent battery life by any standard.</p><p>The 16E’s camera system leaves the SE in the dust, but it’s no match for the robust system found in the iPhone 16. Regardless, it’s way better than you’d typically expect from a phone at this price.</p><p>Like the 16, the 16e has a 48 MP “Fusion” wide-angle rear camera. It typically doesn’t take photos at 48 MP (though you can do that while compromising color detail). Rather, 24 MP is the target. The 48 MP camera enables 2x zoom that is nearly visually indistinguishable from optical zoom.</p><p>Based on both the specs and photo comparisons, the main camera sensor in the 16e appears to me to be exactly the same as that one found in the 16. We’re just missing the ultra-wide lens (which allows more zoomed-out photos, ideal for groups of people in small spaces, for example) and several extra features like advanced image stabilization, the newest Photographic Styles, and macro photography.</p><p>That’s a lot of missing features, sure, but it’s wild how good this camera is for this price point. Even something like the Pixel 8a can’t touch it (though to be fair, the Pixel 8a is $100 cheaper).</p><p>Video capture is a similar situation: The 16e shoots at the same resolutions and framerates as the 16, but it lacks a few specialized features like Cinematic and Action modes. There’s also a front-facing camera with the TrueDepth sensor for Face ID in that notch, and it has comparable specs to the front-facing cameras we’ve seen in a couple of years of iPhones at this point.</p><p>If you were buying a phone for the cameras, this wouldn’t be the one for you. It’s absolutely worth paying another $200 for the iPhone 16 (or even just $100 for the iPhone 15 for the ultra-wide lens for 0.5x zoom; the 15 is still available in the Apple Store) if that’s your priority.</p><p>But for the 16e’s target consumer (mostly folks with the iPhone 11 or older or an iPhone SE, who just want the cheapest functional iPhone they can get) it’s almost overkill. I’m not complaining, though it’s a contributing factor to the phone’s cost compared to entry-level Android phones and Apple’s old iPhone SE.</p><p>In one fell swoop, the iPhone 16e’s replacement of the iPhone SE eliminates a whole range of legacy technologies that have held on at the lower end of the iPhone lineup for years. Gone are Touch ID, the home button, LCD displays, and Lightning ports—they’re replaced by Face ID, swipe gestures, OLED, and USB-C.</p><p>Newer iPhones have had most of those things for quite some time. The latest feature was USB-C, which came in 2023’s iPhone 15. The removal of the SE from the lineup catches the bottom end of the iPhone up with the top in these respects.</p><p>That said, the SE had maintained one positive differentiator, too: It was small enough to be used one-handed by almost anyone. With the end of the SE and the release of the 16e, the one-handed iPhone is well and truly dead. Of course, most people have been clear they want big screens and batteries above almost all else, so the writing had been on the wall for a while for smaller phones.</p><p>The death of the iPhone SE ushers in a new era for the iPhone with bigger and better features—but also bigger price tags.</p><p>Assessing the iPhone 16e is a challenge. It’s objectively a good phone—good enough for the vast majority of people. It has a nearly top-tier screen (though it clocks in at 60Hz, while some Android phones close to this price point manage 120Hz), a camera system that delivers on quality even if it lacks special features seen in flagships, strong connectivity, and performance far above what you’d expect at this price.</p><p>If you don’t care about extra camera features or nice-to-haves like MagSafe or the Dynamic Island, it’s easy to recommend saving a couple hundred bucks compared to the iPhone 16.</p><p>The chief criticism I have that relates to the 16e has less to do with the phone itself than Apple’s overall lineup. The iPhone SE retailed for $430, nearly half the price of the 16. By making the 16e the new bottom of the lineup, Apple has significantly raised the financial barrier to entry for iOS.</p><p>Now, it’s worth mentioning that a pretty big swath of the target market for the 16e will buy it subsidized through a carrier, so they might not pay that much up front. I always recommend buying a phone directly if you can, though, as carrier subsidization deals are usually worse for the consumer.</p><p>The 16e’s price might push more people to go for the subsidy. Plus, it’s just more phone than some people need. For example, I love a high-quality OLED display for watching movies, but I don’t think the typical iPhone SE customer was ever going to care about that.</p><p>That’s why I believe the iPhone 16e solves more problems for Apple than it does for the consumer. In multiple ways, it allows Apple to streamline production, software support, and marketing messaging. It also drives up the average price per unit across the whole iPhone line and will probably encourage some people who would have spent $430 to spend $600 instead, possibly improving revenue. All told, it’s a no-brainer for Apple.</p><p>It's just a mixed bag for the sort of no-frills consumer who wants a minimum viable phone and who for one reason or another didn’t want to go the Android route. The iPhone 16e is definitely a good phone—I just wish there were more options for that consumer.</p>

    <h1>China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters</h1>

        <p>On a hot, humid Thursday night in Saitama, China's national football team hit its lowest ebb.</p><p>With a minute left on the clock and trailing Japan 6-0, Chinese defenders were likely wishing for the sweet relief of the final whistle.</p><p>But Japan's Takefusa Kubo was not feeling charitable. After watching his team-mates toy with their opponents for a while, he received a pass on the edge of the Chinese box and rammed home Japan's seventh goal.</p><p>The ball rocketed into the roof of the net, and the man known as "Japanese Messi" condemned China to their worst-ever defeat in a World Cup qualifier.</p><p>The 7-0 spanking in September - described as "rock-bottom" by a Shanghai-based newspaper – followed a year-long line of humiliating defeats which included losses to Oman, Uzbekistan and Hong Kong.</p><p>But worse was to come.</p><p>A week later dozens of players, coaches and administrators were arrested for gambling, match-fixing and bribery as part of a two-year probe into corruption in the domestic game.</p><p>And the defeats have continued. On Tuesday, Australia beat China 2-0 in Hangzhou - cementing them at the bottom of their World Cup qualifying group.</p><p>It wasn't long ago that China had dreamed of becoming a footballing superpower.</p><p>The world's largest population, a thriving economy and a determined Communist Party led by an avid football fan, President Xi Jinping. What could go wrong?</p><p>Apparently, quite a lot.</p><p>When Xi came to power in 2012, his love for the sport spurred a drive to reform and improve Chinese football. His dream, he once said, was for China to qualify for the World Cup, host it and, ultimately, win it. These were his "three wishes".</p><p>But a decade later, even Xi seemed to have lost the faith. While making small talk with Thailand's prime minister on the sidelines of an international summit in 2023, the Chinese president was heard saying that China had "got lucky" in a recent victory against Thailand.</p><p>"When China's government puts its mind to something, it very rarely fails," says Mark Dreyer, a Beijing-based sports writer. "Look at electric vehicles, look at the Olympics. Practically any sector you can think of, China is right up there."</p><p>But football, it seems, could not thrive in the grip of the Communist Party.</p><p>A key government report in 2015 noted that The Chinese Football Association (CFA) must have "legal autonomy," and should be "independent" of the General Administration of Sport (GAS).</p><p>Even Xi admitted that if China wanted to succeed, then the Party would have to do what it seldom does: let go.</p><p>And yet, Beijing didn't let go.</p><p>"China's failure in football has become a national embarrassment and figuring out the reasons has become a national obsession," Rowan Simons, author of Bamboo Goalposts: One Man's Quest to Teach the People's Republic of China to Love Football, told the BBC.</p><p>"But to me, the reasons are pretty clear and they tell you a lot about how the country is run."</p><p>The problem, he and others argue, is that China's one-party state imposes decisions from the top. While this is effective for economic growth, it yields poor results in competitive team sports.</p><p>Although Fifa prohibits state interference, Chinese football is rife with political appointments. This is common in China, where the Party controls most aspects of public life.</p><p>The current president of the CFA, Song Cai, is also a Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party. His work, in turn, is overseen by a senior government official at the GAS.</p><p>"Everything has to report upwards to Communist Party bosses. It basically means that non-football people are making football decisions," Mr Dreyer says. "Football has to be grassroots-led. You start at the bottom of the pyramid and the talent starts to funnel up to the top."</p><p>All major footballing nations have a "pyramid" of leagues. The elite professional clubs sit at the top, supported by a deep pool of semi-professional and amateur teams, all of whose players are vying to work their way up.</p><p>Such a pyramid thrives on a culture of playing football, en masse, for fun. The larger the pool to draw from, the better the players at the top will be.</p><p>"If you look at every country where football is really successful, the sport has grown organically as a grassroots activity over the past 100 years," Mr Simons says. "Professional football in China has continually failed because it's supported by nothing - their pyramid is upside down."</p><p>The statistics bear this out: England's 1.3 million registered players dwarf China's fewer-than-100,000 footballers. This is in spite of China's population being 20 times larger than England's.</p><p>"Kids here don't grow up with a ball at their feet. Without that, you're not going to produce elite talent," Mr Dreyer says.</p><p>Top-level football in Europe and South America traces its origins to streets and parks in every town and village. In China, however, the push began in Beijing.</p><p>It wasn't until the 1990s that the government set up the country's first professional league. It created a handful of top clubs in major cities - but neglected the grassroots.</p><p>Keen to impress their bosses, officials in this top-down system inevitably opt for a "short-termist" approach that sacrifices genuine improvement over time for quick fixes, Mr Dreyer explains.</p><p>Some foreigners who have played in China say such a heavily controlled system also leaves little room for young players to develop a natural understanding of the game.</p><p>A European currently playing in China, who did not wish to reveal his name, told the BBC that while many Chinese players are "technically good", they lack "football IQ" at crucial moments on the pitch.</p><p>"Creativity and basic decision-making, which we learn instinctively as a kid, you don't see so much here," the player says.</p><p>This does not mean that there is not a deep love for football in China.</p><p>While the men's team, currently ranked 90th in the world, is seen as a constant disappointment, the women's team, ranked 17th, has been a source of pride for years.</p><p>Many in China have referred to them as the "real" guozu or national team - and in 2023, a record 53 million people tuned in to watch them play - and lose 6-1 - to England at the World Cup.</p><p>The men's Super League boasts the highest average attendance of any league in Asia. At its peak in the 2010s, it was attracting big-name foreign players as it rode a wave of investment from state-owned enterprises, buoyed by a thriving economy.</p><p>But it was short-lived.</p><p>Since the pandemic and the subsequent economic slowdown in China, more than 40 professional clubs have folded as state-backed companies started to pull their investments. Private companies, too, have proved fickle in their commitment.</p><p>In 2015, the Suning Appliance Group, which also used to own the top Italian club Inter Milan, bought Jiangsu FC. The club went on to win the Super League in 2020. But months later, Suning said they were closing the club to focus on their retail business.</p><p>The demise of Guangzhou Evergrande, China's most successful team ever, is yet another example.</p><p>Bankrolled by property giant Evergrande Group, they won trophy after trophy under the management of Italian greats such as Marcello Lippi and Fabio Cannavaro. But as they found glory at home and in Asia, their parent company was overstretching itself in an inflated property market.</p><p>Evergrande is now the world's most indebted property company and the poster-child for China's real estate crisis, with arrears of more than $300bn (£225bn).</p><p>Its former club - now in the hands of new owners - wasexpelled from the league in January. After years of splurging, the eight-time champions are still struggling to pay off their debt.</p><p>But that is not the only crisis engulfing Chinese football. Its rapid rise created another problem: corruption.</p><p>"I should have followed the right path. I was just doing what was customary at the time," says Li Tie, the former manager of China's national men's team, in a 2024 documentary.</p><p>In that documentary, Li makes a shocking admission: for years he fixed matches and paid bribes to get certain jobs, including 3m yuan (£331,000, $418,500) to become the national team coach in 2019.</p><p>Dressed in all-black, he marks a written confession with an inky fingerprint: "I'm very sorry."</p><p>China's national team was made to watch the documentary by state broadcaster CCTV while preparing for last year's Asian Cup in Qatar.</p><p>The primetime expose, co-produced by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), was the first episode of a four-part series on corruption in China called Continued Efforts, Deepening Progress.</p><p>In it, dozens of Chinese officials confess - always to camera - to staggering levels of corruption across a variety of industries.</p><p>By airing the football episode first, the authorities signalled their serious concern about graft within the sport.</p><p>Li, who appeared in a World Cup and once played for Premier League side Everton, is the most high-profile figure to have been apprehended last year in an unprecedented slew of anti-corruption arrests in Chinese football.</p><p>In December, he wassentenced to 20 years in jail.</p><p>Also publicly shamed in the documentary are former CFA chairman Chen Xuyuan and ex-deputy director of the GAS, Du Zhaocai.</p><p>"The corruption of these officials has broken our hearts," one fan told CCTV. "I'm not surprised," said another.</p><p>The documentary echoed what one ex-national team player told a BBC radio documentary in 2015 in an anonymous interview: that there was a system of "open bidding" among players for their spot in the squad.</p><p>"I could have won many more caps, but I didn't have the cash," he said.</p><p>It would take another 10 years before corruption in football exploded into the spotlight. Some suggest this was prompted by China's intolerably bad performances on the pitch.</p><p>The struggles of China's men's football team are all the more stark given how other sports are flourishing in the country.</p><p>Decades of investment in infrastructure and training have taken China from a sporting backwater to a medal-winning machine that recently equalled the United States with 40 golds at the Paris Olympics.</p><p>But many of these are individual sports - weightlifting, swimming, diving -  which require fewer resources and, crucially, less emphasis on community-led grassroots efforts, compared to a game like football.</p><p>They are also less lucrative and, therefore, less vulnerable to corruption and mismanagement.</p><p>As China's economy reels from a sustained downturn, its officials have bigger challenges than football woes.</p><p>But that is little consolation to fans.</p><p>The loss to Japan particularly stung. While Japan have gone from strength to strength over the past two decades, China have failed to qualify for a single World Cup.</p><p>The day after the loss, the Oriental Sports Daily did not mince its words: "When the taste of bitterness reaches its extreme, all that is left is numbness."</p><p>According to Mr Dreyer, Japan's approach is antithetical to China's: a long-term vision, a lack of political interference and a commercially savvy club structure.</p><p>"Even so, the fan culture here [in China] is still remarkably good," he adds. "They deserve so much more."</p><p>Their disappointment showed following Tuesday's defeat against Australia - but so did their humour.</p><p>"It seems like the national team's performance is as consistent as ever," wrote one fan on social media. Another joked that if China wants to continue thriving economically, then its football team must suffer so there is a balance in "national fortune".</p><p>Perhaps they had resigned themselves to what a popular Chinese journalist had written in his blog after Japan beat China.</p><p>Football "cannot be boosted by singing odes or telling stories", he noted. "It needs skill, and physical and tactical training. It cannot be accomplished through politics."</p>

        <p>Six Russian tourists have died after a tourist submarine sank in the Red Sea near the Egyptian city of Hurghada.</p><p>Thirty-nine other people were rescued after the vessel - the Sindbad - sank at about 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT), officials say. Nine are said to have been injured with four in critical condition.</p><p>Two of those who died were children, Russia's Tass news agency reports, citing a Russian official.</p><p>Authorities are still investigating and it is currently not known what caused the incident.</p><p>This is the second incident involving a tourist vessel in the Red Sea in recent months. In November, a boat capsized near Marsa Allam, which left 11 people missing, presumed dead.</p><p>The Sindbad had been in operation as a tourist submarine for a number of years.</p><p>Sindbad Submarines, the company running the trips, says its vessels take passengers on journeys to explore coral reefs near the Hurghada coastline.</p><p>The Red Sea governor, Amr Hanafy, said the 45 passengers on the Sindbad were from Russia, India, Norway and Sweden. Five Egyptian crew members were also on board.</p><p>Mr Hanafy said the six who died were all Russian, but full details of the victims have not yet been released.</p><p>Two married doctors are among those who have died and their daughters remain in hospital, authorities said.</p><p>An investigation into the incident is ongoing, but the Association of Tour Operators of Russia cited in a Telegram post the submarine hit a reef and subsequently lost pressure while at a depth of 20 metres (65 feet).</p><p>The city of Hurghada is located to the south-east of Cairo - a tourist destination which is known both for its beaches and coral reefs.</p><p>Sindbad Submarines' website says its tours allow passengers to travel 25 metres (82 feet) underwater.</p><p>Dr James Aldridge from Bristol took the same trip on the submarine in February 2025. He told the BBC: "The sub was well-maintained and was as shown in the promotional photos.</p><p>"Fresh paint, modern equipment and with attentive and professional English-speaking staff (including two divers to accompany you down)."</p><p>He explained passengers listened to a safety briefing, which had been recorded in multiple languages, and said that life jackets were not issued.</p><p>"We toured the reef for 40 minutes. For the first 20 I was facing the reef, the sub never strayed 'too close' and I never felt unsafe. For the return trip, I was facing the ocean," he added.</p>

    <h1>Australia to hold federal election on 3 May</h1>

        <p>Australia will head to the polls for a federal election on 3 May.</p><p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose Labor Party will be defending a small majority, announced the date after visitingthe Governor General in the capital, Canberra, on Friday.</p><p>Opinion polls predict a slim margin between the country's two major parties, and the possibility that either will have to work with independent MPs or minor parties - which combined won a record share of the vote at the last election in 2022 - to form the next government.</p><p>The campaign is expected to be dominated by cost-of-living issues, and Labor is fighting to avoid becoming the first single-term government to lose an election in almost a century.</p><p>In a press conference on Friday morning, Albanese reiterated his pledge to address the cost of living - having already unveiled plans to provide more free doctor visits and deliver small tax cuts - and said electing his rival Peter Dutton would be a step backwards for the country.</p><p>"It was always going to take more than three years to clean up 10 years of mess," he said on Friday, referring to the previous coalition government he defeated in 2022.</p><p>Never has voters' choice been more important, or more clear, he said: "This election is a choice between Labor's plan to keep building or Peter Dutton's promise to cut."</p><p>The opposition leader, however, has argued the Albanese government has failed to improve the lives of Australians, and it is his party that has the solutions.</p><p>He is expected to speak later on Friday, but has been promising to "get Australia back on track" and improve the economy by slimming down the public service, making fuel cheaper and improving Australia's energy security.</p><p>The affordability of housing and groceries is at the top of voters' minds, as well as access to healthcare, though concern about managing record immigration and reducing crime is increasing significantly. Climate action - the feature of the last election - remains important to many Australians too.</p><p>Politics in Australia - where voting is compulsory for adults - is traditionally dominated by Labor and the Liberal-National coalition. Either party needs to win at least 76 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - where the prime minister sits - to form a majority government.</p><p>One of the country's longest serving politicians, Albanese took power in 2022 after long period of political instability, in which the country changed leader six times in only eight years.</p><p>He promised unity and integrity and - after a campaign marked by anger over Australia's emissions reductions efforts - vowed to "end the climate wars".</p><p>Albanese's government enshrined into law a boosted emissions cut target, and introduced a mechanism that acts as a carbon cap for the country's biggest emitters - though experts say more ambition is needed.</p><p>However, Albanese's key goal of achieving constitutional recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and establishing a parliamentary advisory body for them, failed at a referendum in 2023.</p><p>And he has come under pressure over global economic conditions which have exacerbated cost-of-living pain in Australia - and played a part in the downfall of several incumbent governments around the world in the past year.</p><p>Last year, he came under fire after it emerged that he had bought a A$4.3m ($2.9m, £2.2m) cliff-top home amid a national housing crisis.</p><p>Australians have not ousted a government from Canberra after only a single term since 1931.</p><p>Dutton - who was a police officer in Queensland before he was elected - has more than 20 years in parliament under his belt, many of them spent as a senior minister handling key portfolios like health, immigration, defence and home affairs.</p><p>He built a reputation as a hard-line conservative best known for overseeing Australia's controversial policies on asylum seekers, and his role in the downfall of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.</p><p>He has styled himself as a cultural warrior - opposing same sex marriage, diversity and inclusion initiatives and the Voice to Parliament referendum - but has in recent times tried to shake his tough public persona, which he says doesn't accurately reflect who he is.</p>

    <h1>UK child poverty numbers reach a record high</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>The number of children in poverty in the UK has reached its highest level since comparative records began in 2002.</p><p>In the year to April 2024, there were 4.45 million children living in a household of relative low income after housing costs are deducted - the government's own standard measure for poverty.</p><p>The figure, released by the Department for Work and Pensions, is an increase of 100,000 children from the previous year - and equates to 31% of children in the UK.</p><p>The figure has risen sharply since 2021 and the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) predicts 4.8 million children will be in poverty by the end of this Parliament in 2029-30.</p><p>It is calling for the government to scrap the two-child benefit limit in its upcoming child poverty strategy, and to pause the recent proposals for wider benefit cuts.</p><p>The two-child cap prevents parents from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third child, with a few exemptions.</p><p>The relative poverty definition - which is measured both before and after housing costs - refers to people living in households with income below 60% of the country's median average figure.</p><p>Separately, the Scottish government hasmissed its legal targets for reducing child poverty for 2023-24.</p><p></p><p>"The latest data is a stark reminder of the scale of deprivation among families, with close to a third of children in Britain now living in poverty," said Adam Corlett, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank.</p><p>"This is before any additional impact from new benefit cuts and a weak living standards outlook, which are set to reduce incomes across the poorest half of working-age households by £500 over the next five years."</p><p>Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, work and pensions minister Sir Stephen Timms said the figures "show just what a huge challenge" the "very high level of child poverty that's left by the previous government" is for Labour.</p><p>He added: "We're going to be addressing that".</p><p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed a shake-up to the benefits system on Wednesday. This includes halving incapacity benefits for new claimants, and tighter criteria around the Personal Independence Payment for those with long term physical or mental health conditions.</p><p>An extra 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, will be pushed into relative poverty by these changes,according to the government's own impact assessment.</p><p>In the three years to 2024, the highest child poverty rates after housing costs were in the West Midlands and London, although London's levels were among the lowest if housing was not factored in.</p><p>One in five families who had one child were living in poverty, compared with 44% of those who had three children or more.</p><p>The Resolution Foundation echoed calls for the government to scrap the two-child benefit limit and wants the government to extend free school meal entitlement to all families on Universal Credit.</p><p>When Labour took power in the summer of 2024, after the period covered by the figures, the prime minister announced the creation of a child poverty task force, promising to leave "no stone unturned" in tackling the root causes of the issue.</p><p>The cross-government child poverty strategy is due to be published in spring 2025.</p><p>"No-one should be living in poverty, and we know that the best route out of poverty for struggling families is well paid, secure work, a Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said.</p><p>"That is why we are reforming our broken welfare system so it helps people into good jobs, boosting living standards and putting money in people's pockets," they added.</p>

    <h1>King experiences temporary side effects of cancer treatment</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>King Charles III spent a short period of time in hospital on Thursday after experiencing temporary side effects during cancer treatment, Buckingham Palace said.</p><p>The King returned to Clarence House, where he was said to be continuing to work on state papers and make calls from his study. He has cancelled a tour of Birmingham on Friday, acting on medical advice.</p><p>Charles, 76, had planned to travel to the city for a busy schedule of engagements, which included four events.</p><p>The palace first announced the King's cancer diagnosis in February 2024.</p><p>A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said meetings with three ambassadors on Thursday were also affected.</p><p>"Tomorrow, he was due to undertake four public engagements in Birmingham and is greatly disappointed to be missing them on this occasion," the palace's statement added.</p><p>"He very much hopes that they can be rescheduled in due course and offers his deepest apologies to all those who had worked so hard to make the planned visit possible."</p><p>A palace source described it as a "most minor bump in a road that is very much heading in the right direction".</p><p>The palace did not provide further information over what his side effects were.</p><p>Queen Camilla attended a reception in Wembley, north London on Thursday and did not join the King during his brief stay at hospital.</p><p>The underlying message from the palace is one of reassurance – with the postponement of the visit to Birmingham presented as a brief setback against an otherwise optimistic picture on the King's health.</p><p>There was no drama, they went to the London Clinic hospital in central London in a car and not an ambulance, and the late night announcement followed a decision that it was wiser to postpone Friday's visit.</p><p>It might also have seemed wiser to get ahead of the news and remain transparent about a minor problem, rather than make it a major event with a last-minute cancellation.</p><p>His cancer treatment is ongoing but the King has seemed keen not to be defined by his illness. He seems to thrive on meeting crowds and has shown no signs of slowing down, with a full set of engagements.</p><p>In recent weeks, he has been on a trip to Northern Ireland, he launched a playlist of favourite music and attended the Commonwealth Day service, having missed it last year after his cancer diagnosis.</p><p>The King has been centre-stage in recent weeks, unexpectedly involved in global diplomacy.</p><p>After inviting President Donald Trump for a second state visit to the UK, the King then showed solidarity with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky after his disastrous meeting with Trump in the White House.</p><p>He also gave a warm welcome to Mark Carney, Canada's new prime minister, whose country has been under pressure from Trump.</p><p>None of that suggested that the monarch was running out of energy. And thepostponement of the state visit to the Vatican, announced earlier this week, had been about the health of Pope Francis rather than the King - with the rest of the visit to Italy expected to go ahead.</p><p>While recognising that it is impossible to rule out any further health problems, the message from Buckingham Palace is that the King is expected to be back to normal in terms of his diary next week.</p><p>The King's wider state visit to Italy is also set to continue in April with some alterations to the planned programme, the palace said this week.</p><p>The palace has never disclosed what type of cancer the King has. He returned to public duties last April after a period of treatment and recuperation.</p>

    <h1>Men make sacrifices many women don't for top jobs, Farage says</h1>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Men are prepared to sacrifice family lives for successful careers in a way many women aren't, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said.</p><p>Speaking at an event in Parliament, Farage argued people should be judged on merit  in the workplace, not on certain characteristics.</p><p>When asked whether most top jobs would go to white men on merit, Farage said that, in many cases, women make "very different life choices" to men.</p><p>"Look at business," he said. "Men are prepared to sacrifice their family lives in order to pursue a career and be successful in a way that fewer women are.</p><p>"And those women that do have probably got more of a chance of reaching the top than the blokes."</p><p>His comments came at a lunch with journalists on Wednesday, with Farage making a speech and taking questions on a range of topical issues.</p><p>As Reform UK leader, Farage sets the direction for the party of more than 200,000 members and four members of Parliament.</p><p>Farage praised US President Donald Trump's drive to scrap diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) policies, designed to prevent discrimination in the workplace.</p><p>DEI programmes aim to promote participation in workplaces by people from a range of backgrounds.</p><p>Their backers say they address historical or ongoing discrimination and underrepresentation of certain groups, including racial minorities, but critics argue such programmes can themselves be discriminatory.</p><p>Asked why the world of business had been dominated by white men in the past, Farage said: "Because the country was white men, the country of business was white men.</p><p>He added: "Men went to work, women stayed at home and brought up kids. The world has evolved and changed since then.</p><p>"The world is changing. The world is changing. Women in work. Changes in population.</p><p>"But the idea that you give certain groups privileges not based on merit but based on skin colour or sexuality or whatever is wrong, it doesn't work."</p><p>Farage leads a group of four male MPs in the House of Commons, but said he was very "pro-women".</p><p>This week, the party announced its candidatefor the upcoming Runcorn and Helsby by-electionas former Cheshire East councillor and local magistrate Sarah Pochin.</p><p>Farage said: "Have we picked her because she's a woman? No. We picked her because the best candidate."</p><p>He said Reform UK could "do with more female figures", but added "we'll get them through merit".</p><p>Opinion polls consistently suggest Reform UK is more popular among men than women.</p><p>A YouGov poll in Januaryindicated 30% of men and 19% of women would vote for the party in a hypothetical general election.</p><p>Farage faced a question about what he planned to do to appeal to female voters.</p><p>He said young men were "more attracted to small-c conservatism" and suggested they backed his party because they were more "impulsive" than women.</p><p>"That has nothing to do with me whatsoever, that's just the way it is," he said.</p><p>Farage said society was trying to "feminise" young men in a way that made the views of self-proclaimed misogynist influencer Andrew Tate more appealing to them.</p><p>But Farage stressed: "I'm not a Tate supporter. I'm identifying the truth, that young men feel that they're not allowed to be blokes."</p><p>Farage's relationship with tech billionaire and senior Trump adviser Elon Musk also came up during the event.</p><p>Musk had been a vocal supporter of Reform and last year, Farage told journalists his party was in negotiations with the Tesla CEO about a potential donation.</p><p>But there was a rift between them over Musk's support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson.</p><p>Farage said when he met Musk in the US, the billionaire took "a different view on Tommy Robinson to me".</p><p>The Reform UK leader said he'd never supported Robinson and Musk "tried to push me a bit".</p><p>"You know what, you can't bully me," Farage said. "I've got principles and I stand by them."</p>

        <p>Five people have been injured following a stabbing near the central Dam Square in Amsterdam, police say.</p><p>The injured include two Americans, a Polish man, a Belgian woman and a Dutch woman.

        <p>Bill Sweeney was appointed to his position in May 2019</p><p>Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney has survived a vote of no confidence at a special general meeting.</p><p>The motion, which called for the RFU board to terminate Sweeney's employment, was voted against by 65%.</p><p>Those supporting the motion, such as the referees' union and Championship clubs, had cited various perceived governance failures on Sweeney's watch.</p><p>"I am pleased to see such a decisive outcome," said interim chairman Sir Bill Beaumont.</p><p>"I trust that those who supported this motion will honour and accept the result on this tonight and lets work forward to make changes.</p><p>"Let's stand together, and focus on what we can achieve together, and work to ensure that the Rugby Football Union continues to thrive, evolve, and lead the way in rugby.</p><p>"The time for division is behind us. The time for collaboration is now."</p><p>Sweeney, 67, had beenwidely criticised for taking home £1.1m last yearat a time of record RFU losses.</p><p>The RFU declared £37.9m operating losses last year, only a few weeks after announcing plans to lay off more than 40 staff in the latest round of redundancies.</p><p>A second motion, to expedite governance reform in the English game, was overwhelmingly supported at the meeting.</p><p>The motion to oust Sweeney was proposed on Thursday by Paddy McAlpine, the co-chair of the Whole Game Union and chair of Chichester Rugby Club.</p><p>"We bring this motion not for disruption, but because we believe change is necessary and overdue," McAlpine said.</p><p>"The game is being let down by those entrusted to lead it. It is no longer just flawed - it is dangerously inadequate.</p><p>"This is not just a vote - this is a turning point, the chance to say we want a better future for English rugby."</p><p>Through the course of the 58-minute discussion, various club members, constituent bodies, council and board members spoke up either in support or defence of the motion, before the vote was taken.</p><p>The motion received 466 votes against and 206 votes for, with 36 abstaining.</p><p>'Rancour & disruption'- Beaumont warns against rebel vote</p><p>Listen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate</p><p>Listen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast</p><p>Speaking against the motion, RFU board member Wayne Barnes strenuously defended Sweeney's record in his six years in the role, and said his departure would leave a significant void at the top of English rugby.</p><p>"He takes all of those relationships, that experience and that influence with him," former referee Barnes said.</p><p>"The void would be filled by someone who does not know the landscape."</p><p>Barnes also insisted the majority of referees did not back the motion, despite the Rugby Football Referees' Union bringing the motion in the first place.</p><p>"This is a time for rugby to now come together," Barnes said. "I really hope we can start to celebrate the enormous positives there are in the game."</p><p>However, speaking on behalf of the RFU board, Barnes pledged the powers-that-be will continue to listen to the game in a bid to end months of discord and heal the cracks in English rugby.</p><p>"There is clearly a lot of work to be done to restore our relationship with the community game," he added. "We need to focus on restoring trust."</p><p>A second motion, which was brought forward by the RFU board, called for the expedition of governance reform, devolving more power to the community game.</p><p>This motion was passed by 554 votes to 127.</p><p>"These reforms will represent a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change the RFU," said Paula Carter, RFU board member and council member for Surrey.</p><p>Beaumont added: "Let us put this period of infighting behind us, and instead, unite behind a common mission to modernise the union and its structures.</p><p>"Members have now given us an overwhelming mandate to shake up the archaic structures of how the game is run here, which continue to hold us back.</p><p>"The RFU wants to modernise, and this is an unprecedented opportunity to do exactly that."</p>

    <h1>'I want a good job. I don't want to rely on universal credit'</h1>

        <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivered an update on her plans for the economy on Wednesday, announcing cuts to welfare and the civil service, but also increased spending on defence.</p><p>Reeves faces tough challenges, with the latest official economic forecast downgrading how much the UK economy is predicted to grow this year.</p><p>Those challenges are also being felt on the ground, in people's everyday lives.</p><p>People have contacted the BBC throughYour Voice, Your BBC Newsto tell us how they are feeling about the months ahead and what plans they have to tackle the hurdles they face.</p><p>Health-related benefits were in the firing line when it came to the chancellor's changes to the welfare system.</p><p>Abdullahi Ibrahim from Croydon in south London has ADHD and autism, and receives universal credit (UC) and Personal Independence Payments (Pip).</p><p>His income varies, depending on how many hours he can get each week working as a teaching assistant, due to him being on a zero-hours contract. The more hours he works, the less he receives in UC.</p><p>Under the government's plans, there will be a stricter eligibility test for Pip, the main disability benefit, from November 2026. Under-22s will also no longer be able to claim the incapacity benefit top-up.</p><p>Abdullahi told the BBC the cuts to welfare were "concerning" as he relies on them to top up his income when he cannot secure work hours. He says he isn't sure yet whether his benefits will be impacted, but he'll "just accept it" if they are.</p><p>"It's not like I want to be in this situation. We don't want to be a lost generation," he says of young people like him.</p><p>Abdullahi continues to apply for a range of jobs but wonders when he discloses his health conditions on applications whether some employers decide not to interview or hire him.</p><p>"I do want to work a good contracted job and not rely on it (universal credit)," he says. "It has helped me a lot, but I would love to get more support – if there were more schemes to get into work."</p><p>Radhika Gupta was hoping for improvements to the NHS and cheaper travel costs.</p><p>She was disappointed public transport was not mentioned in Reeves's speech, as she was hoping for more action on reducing travel expenses because it is one of her biggest expenses at around £75 a month.</p><p>The student from Derry in Northern Ireland is in the third year of a five-year medical degree at Queen's University in Belfast.</p><p>She is pleased that NHS England is being dissolved as it "cuts out the middleman".</p><p>"If something is going wrong, you can hold the health secretary responsible for that," she says.</p><p>"Considering our healthcare is already a bit stretched, it'll be a long period of time before we get used to it," she adds, but suggests it could save money for the NHS in the long run.</p><p>Her parents and maintenance loan give her about £800 a month, which she supplements with tutoring and casual work in hospitality. Her rent is £600. There are extra costs like her scrubs - she needs several sets - at £35 a set.</p><p>"Things are quite tight," she says.</p><p>However, the fact the minimum wage is going up in April is something that she's happy with.</p><p>"Every penny counts, especially when you're a student," she says.</p><p>"I'm working paycheque to paycheque," says Dylan Caulkin. "If I have a tyre that pops, I rely on credit."</p><p>The teaching assistant, who lives with his parents near Truro, Cornwall, is about to start a new job as a support worker for people with learning difficulties.</p><p>At £12.24 an hour, his pay will be only just above the levelthe minimum wage is rising to in April. But it is more than he is getting in his current role.</p><p>"I'm very excited," he says. The opportunity for doing overtime, too, means the change will have a "massive impact" on his finances.</p><p>He pays his parents £160 a month rent and contributes to food costs, which are higher for him as he is on a gluten-free diet. His car - a necessity, he says - costs about £500 a month to run. And he has a small amount of credit card debt he is currently trying to clear.</p><p>He sometimes has £100 left over at the end of the month for spending on himself.</p><p>"I'm very lucky to have family around me," he says. "I wouldn't be able to survive without them."</p><p>He would like to see the government provide more help for young people like him.</p><p>"In the near-future I'm looking to move in with my partner but it is just so expensive."</p><p>Businessman Lincoln Smith owns and runs Custom Heat, a plumbing firm based in Rugby.</p><p>He saw Reeves's announcements as having a positive impact on his business, as the push to build more homes will mean more demand for plumbers.</p><p>"Things look more rosy for us. That the OBR (the government's financial watchdog) have proofed it all and validated it all, is all good," he says.</p><p>While he welcomes the chancellor's promise to build 1.5 million homes in the next five years, he says there is a skills shortage and tax rises will only make the problem worse.</p><p>"How on Earth are we going to build those homes? Brick and pipe layers are on the decline significantly.</p><p>"We are not on taking apprenticeships because of risingNational Insurance and other costs- once they hit 20 years old, they are on a £25k salary and become unaffordable," he says.</p><p>Lincoln himself is taking a 20% pay cut to help balance the books for the forthcoming financial year.</p><p>He'll be earning £125,000, while his wife, who also works for the business, earns £45,000.</p><p>"It sounds like a lot," he admits, but the cut will still mean lifestyle changes. "When you are earning any salary, you set your outgoings based on it."</p><p>With a mortgage of £3,000 a month they are already at "breakeven point", he says.</p><p>"We haven't booked a holiday this year. We are definitely not going away," he says.</p><p>But if that is not enough he will look at moving house to reduce the mortgage.</p><p>It's a bit upsetting, he says, because it's the only house his sons, aged seven and four, have known.</p><p>"I know it's 'first world problems'," he says. "You've just got to do what you've got to do."</p><p>"There doesn't seem to be anything good on the horizon," says Malcolm Hindley, a retired window cleaner from Liverpool.</p><p>A widower, he lives with his daughter, who "does everything round the house" and cares for him and her disabled daughter.</p><p>He owns his own house, but finds it hard to get by on his £200-a-week state pension, plus attendance allowance of around £80 a week.</p><p>He needs a car to get to the shops and medical appointments, and has just been in a car accident that has left him with a neck brace, on top of existing mobility issues.</p><p>He says the chancellor's Spring Statement was a "waste of time".</p><p>"It's just hitting the poor again, isn't it? I don't really know what I was expecting - I certainly wasn't expecting more cuts.</p><p>"She is hitting the poor and worse off."</p><p>Losing thewinter fuel paymentwas hard for Malcolm, because he feels the cold more as he gets older.</p><p>He doesn't have much left at the end of the month, but what he does have goes on ice creams and sweets for the grandchildren.</p><p>"When you see their faces it's brilliant," he says.</p><p>What happens next with interest rates is what matters most to Ellie Richardson and Billy Taylor.</p><p>They found their dream home for £350,000 last year, but the sale has been delayed and now won't be completed beforestamp duty rises at the end of this month, costing them an extra £2,500.</p><p>"You have to roll with the punches," says Ellie, who works in sports PR. But they hope mortgage rates aren't also about to go up.</p><p>She and Billy, a builder, have been shuttling between his parents' and her parents' houses in Essex for the past three years.</p><p>"We've worked really hard to save as much as we can for this house," she says. "We're pretty set on it."</p><p>They have a joint income of around £80,000 and they have a mortgage offer that would see them pay around £1,200 a month.</p><p>But if the house purchase is delayed too long, they may end up having to apply for a new mortgage.</p><p>"The silver lining is, if we do complete later in the year, then hopefully mortgage rates could be lower," she says.</p><p>Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell & Emma Pengelly.</p>

    <h1>Doctor 'betrayed' over son's death at her hospital</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>A doctor who rushed her seriously ill son to the east London hospital where she worked, and where he later died of sepsis, says she feels "betrayed" by the way her family were treated.</p><p>William Hewes, 22, died within 24 hours of being admitted to Homerton University Hospital after his meningitis developed into sepsis in January 2023.</p><p>Dr Deborah Burns said she had repeatedly queried the speed of his treatment and has since been unable to "go back and work for an organisation that doesn't acknowledge its errors and learn from them".</p><p>A coroner has criticised the hospital but said she could not conclude if earlier treatment would have saved Mr Hewes. The hospital said it would learn from what happened.</p><p>Mr Hewes became unwell at about 13:30 GMT on 20 January and said he felt cold and had a headache.</p><p>His condition deteriorated during the afternoon and he got up after going to bed that night to tell his mother he felt very unwell and had bruising on his belly.</p><p>Suspecting meningococcal sepsis, his mother rang the hospital emergency department to warn them she and her son were on the way.</p><p>While at the hospital Dr Burns – who was a specialist in paediatrics at Homerton University Hospital – said she had asked staff on eight separate occasions if they had given him antibiotics.</p><p>"I wasn't clock-watching but I knew they were not given straight away," she said.</p><p>"I thought the nurse was prioritising other things, medication to treat his symptoms.  It wasn't medication that was going to change the outcome of what he had."</p><p>Giving evidence during the inquest, the medical staff who treated Mr Hewes said they did not recall Dr Burns asking for antibiotics eight times.</p><p>Senior coroner Mary Hassell said she accepted Dr Burns' evidence on this point, although she believed hospital staff were not being deliberately untruthful but had not heard an instruction from the registrar to administer antibiotics and fluids, as well as medication for his symptoms.</p><p>She added that Mr Hewes did not receive the antibiotics and fluids "with the urgency that he should have".</p><p>Nevertheless, while delivering a narrative verdict she said the 22-year-old was already very unwell when he arrived at the hospital and it was not clear if would have survived had he been treated quicker.</p><p>Following her son's death, Dr Burns was told that Homerton University Hospital was going to investigate what happened.</p><p>But months later she learned they had decided against an inquiry, as "there were no delays, there weren't any concerns about his treatment".</p><p>She told the BBC she "couldn't understand why no investigation had been done... and also why I hadn't been informed of the outcome".</p><p>Dr Burns added she had been unable to return to work as she had planned, due to the way she says the hospital has treated her family since her son's death.</p><p>"I am now much more aware of the deeply ingrained, defensive culture within the NHS. I trusted them, I felt betrayed," she said.</p><p>"It has been totally unnecessary. If it can happen to me, then I really worry for the general population."</p><p>She now has a diagnosis of complex grief.</p><p>"I haven't been able to walk away from this in the last two years," she explained. "And it's all deeply meshed with the loss of my very much adored youngest son."</p><p>The coroner said she would issue a prevention of future deaths report to Homerton University Hospital, calling on it to share the changes it had made since Mr Hewes' death.</p><p>Solicitor Deborah Nadel, who represented Dr Burns during the inquest, said: "The coroner has made it very clear yet again how concerned she is about catastrophic errors in sepsis care.</p><p>"How many more times must a coroner flag their concerns about hospital practices around sepsis, and how many more times must a lawyer flag the terrible impact on families for things to change?"</p><p>A spokesperson for Homerton Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said Dr Burns had "told us that our policies and processes for this situation are inadequate and detached and we are determined to learn from her experience.</p><p>"This work will ensure a more personal response for staff members or members of their family who are patients here."</p><p>The trust added an action plan had been drawn up after Mr Hewes' death, with changes introduced including making sure an intensive care doctor attends the bedside of a patient with suspected sepsis and delivering further training on recognising sepsis symptoms.</p><p>Symptoms include:</p><p>If you think you or someone you look after has symptoms of sepsis, call 999 or go to A&E.</p><p>Source: NHS</p><p>Listen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

        <p>Six people have died after a tourist submarine sank in the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt, a local governor has said.</p><p>Among 39 others who were rescued, nine were said to have been injured,with four of themin critical condition, after the incident early on Thursday morning near the city of Hurghada.</p><p>In total, 45 passengers were thought to have been on-board the submarine, called Sindbad, when it sank close to the harbour.</p><p>Here is what we know so far.</p><p>The Red Sea area governor, Amr Hanafy, said six tourists died and 39 further people were rescued after the submarine sank. No people are missing.</p><p>He said the 45 passengers on board were from Russia, India, Norway and Sweden. There were also five Egyptians on board.</p><p>All of those who died were from Russia. A Russian official in Hurghada, Viktor Voropaev, said that two of those killed were children. Authorities in the Russian republic of Tatarstan told Russian media that two others who died were married doctors.</p><p>An earlier statement from the Russian embassy in Egypt had said all of the tourists on board were Russian.</p><p>The submarine, Sindbad, had been in operation as a tourist submarine for a number of years.</p><p>According to the company running the tourist trips - Sindbad Submarines - its vessels take passengers on journeys to explore coral reefs near the Hurghada coastline.</p><p>The company says it holds two of the only "14 real recreational submarines" in the world, which hold 44 seats for passengers and two seats for pilots.</p><p>Tours are designed for both adults and children, the company's website says, and allow passengers to travel 25 metres (82 feet) underwater.</p><p>Dr James Aldridge, who took the same trip on one of the company's submarines last month, said each passenger is given "a seat on a cushion next to your window and there is a recorded safety brief in multiple languages".</p><p>The vessel "wasn't cramped or overcrowded", Dr Aldridge, from Bristol, said, adding that he "never felt unsafe".</p><p>"The sub departed and we toured the reef for 40 minutes," he said. "For the first 20 I was facing the reef, the sub never strayed 'too close'."</p><p>According to Dr Aldridge, the divers accompanying the submarine "used fish food to attract the wildlife" to keep the passengers entertained.</p><p>Dr Aldridge said the submarine "never went close" to a 25-metre depth.</p><p>He was not, however, issued a life jacket.</p><p>Benjamin Grey, 50, from Camberley, also took a trip on a Sindbad submarine in February - but had quite a different experience.</p><p>He boarded with his 13-year-old daughter and his partner, and said he noticed "problems" during the trip, including the submarine surfacing "at least three times".</p><p>"About halfway through there was a diver who looked like he'd picked up a rock," he said. "He was banging something on the bottom of the submarine. Clearly at some point the submarine had stopped moving and the divers outside were doing something."</p><p>He also said - in contrast to Dr Aldridge - that "no safety procedures were talked through".</p><p>The submarine sank around one kilometre (0.6 miles)off the coast of the Egyptian Red Sea city of Hurghada, the BBC understands.</p><p>The Russian embassy said it happened around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT), about 0.6 miles (1km) from the shore.</p><p>Hurghada is a popular tourist destination, with its coastline known for its beaches and coral reefs. A number of tourist trip companies operate out of its harbour.</p><p>In recent years, there have been other incidents involving Red Sea tourist boats operating out of the city.</p><p>In November, a tourist boat called the Sea Story sank, leaving 11 dead or missing - including a British couple - and 35 survivors. The BBC later heardaccusations of safety failings on board.</p><p>UK investigators said last monththere had been 16 incidents involving "liveaboard" vessels in the area in the last five years, with a number resulting in deaths.</p><p>Authorities in Egypt are investigating the cause of the incident, and details are currently unclear.</p><p>There continues to be a lot of activity from other boats around the harbour near where the submarine sank.</p><p>Red Sea governor Amr Hanafy said the submarine had a valid licence and the crew leader had the correct "scientific certificates".</p><p>It appeared that the weather was quite calm with no sign of any rough waters.</p>

    <h1>Why Rachel Reeves may have to raise UK taxes in October</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">BBC News</span>
        <span class="date">Thu, 27 Mar 2025 17:24:04 GMT</span>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out her plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement and is on track to meet her self-imposed rules on the public finances, which she has said are "non-negotiable".</p><p>On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?</p><p>It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.</p><p>Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.</p><p>In October, the government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said that Reeves would be able to meet that rule with £9.9bn to spare.</p><p>An increase in government borrowing costs since then meant that that room to spare had disappeared. Now big welfare cuts and spending reductions in the Spring Statement have restored it.</p><p>Almost £10bn may sound like a lot, but it's a relatively small amount in an economy that spends £1 trillion a year, and raises around the same in tax.</p><p>In fact it is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time is three times bigger at £30bn.</p><p>"It is a tiny fraction of the risks to the outlook," Richard Hughes from the OBR told the BBC.</p><p>He said there were many factors that could "wipe out" the chancellor's headroom, including an escalating trade war, any small downgrade to growth forecasts or a rise in interest rates.</p><p>Which brings us on to the precarious nature of making economic forecasts.</p><p>"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong," says Mr Hughes.</p><p>Predicting what will happen in the future, especially in five years' time is hard, and is subject to revisions. You could be forgiven for not predicting a war or a pandemic, for instance.</p><p>The respected think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has already said there is "a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget".</p><p>A case in point, only hours after Reeves delivered her statement in parliament, US President Donald Trumpannounced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts coming into the US.</p><p>Reeves admitted the car tariffs would be "bad for the UK" but insisted the government was in "extensive" talks to avoid them being imposed here.</p><p>According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.</p><p>Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.</p><p>Although 0.2% is a tiny amount, nevertheless it will affect the economy.</p><p>And in the OBR's worst-case scenario, 1% would be knocked off economic growth.</p><p></p><p>Trump's trade policies and the fact that nobody seems to know whether he will follow through with his threats, U-turn on them, or how he will react to others is just one way his presidency is making the world so uncertain at the moment.</p><p>The war in Ukraine continues, despite Trump's pledge to end it.</p><p>The UK, along with Germany, has said it will increase defence spending. Trump has long called for European members of Nato to spend more on defence, and there are also fears that if the US does make a deal with Russia to end the war, that could leave Europe vulnerable.</p><p>Domestically, businesses are also facing a worrying time as they brace for a rise in costs in April as employers' National Insurance contributions, the National Living wage and business rates are all set to go up.</p><p>Some firms have said they have put off investment decisions as a result, and many have warned of price rises or job cuts. If these materialise, then that will knock growth.</p><p>Given all of the above, if the chancellor's headroom were to disappear, why would that matter?</p><p>Reeves has staked her reputation on meeting her fiscal rules, pledging to bring "iron discipline" and provide stability and reassurance to financial markets, in contrast to former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets and raised interest rates.</p><p>So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.</p><p>The government has already announced big cuts to the welfare bill as well as plans to cut the civil service and abolish several quangos including NHS England.</p><p>But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: "Non-defence spending can only be cut so far."</p><p>By leaving herself so little wiggle room and with such a precarious economic outlook, "we can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn," says Paul Johnson from the IFS.</p><p>That speculation itself can cause economic harm, he says.</p><p>Reeves has not ruled out tax rises but told the BBC there were "opportunities" as well as "risks" for the UK economy.</p>

    <h1>Germany leads defiance to Trump car tariffs, saying it 'will not give in'</h1>

        <p>Germany has said it "will not give in" and that Europe must "respond firmly" as US President Donald Trump targets imported cars and car parts with a 25% tax in his latest tariffs.</p><p>Other major world economies have vowed to retaliate, with France's president branding the move "a waste of time" and "incoherent", Canada calling it a "direct attack", and China accusing Washington of violating international trade rules.</p><p>Carmaker stocks from Japan to Germany dipped. In the US, General Motors dropped 7%, while Ford fell more than 2%.</p><p>Trump has threatened to impose "far larger" tariffs if Europe works with Canada to do what he describes as "economic harm" to the US.</p><p>The fresh car tariffs will come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.</p><p>Trump has long maintained the tariffs are part of a drive to help US manufacturing and says if cars are made in America there will be "absolutely no tariff".</p><p>Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.</p><p>While the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for companies reliant on parts from abroad.</p><p>The firms that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.</p><p>The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (£186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales.</p><p>Mexico is the top supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany.</p><p>Analysts have estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group.</p><p>German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the European Union must "respond firmly".</p><p>"It must be clear that we will not give in to the US. We need to show strength and self-confidence," he added.</p><p>France backed this joint approach, with its finance minister saying Europe must retaliate with tariffs on US products.</p><p>At a press conference on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was "not the time" for the US to be imposing tariffs.</p><p>"Imposing tariffs means breaking value chains, it means creating in the short term an inflationary effect and destroying jobs," he said in Paris.</p><p>"All of this is rather a waste of time and will create a lot of worry," he added, urging Trump to reconsider.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a "direct attack" on his country and its car industry, adding it "will hurt us", but trade options were being discussed.</p><p>In the UK, car industry body the SMMT said the car tariffs announcement was "not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing".</p><p>Uniparts founder John Neill said the Trump tariffs were "a gift to the Chinese", because international consumers would respond to a trade war by buying Chinese alternatives.</p><p>Meanwhile, China accused Trump of violating World Trade Organization rules.</p><p>"There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war. No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs," a spokesman for the foreign ministry said.</p><p>There are warnings from Japan that there will be a "significant impact" on the economic relationship it shares with the US. A government spokesman described the measures as "extremely regrettable" and said officials had asked the US for an exemption.</p><p>In South Korea, a day before the latest levy,Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (£16.3bn) in the USand build a new steel plant in Louisiana.</p><p>Trump hailed the investment as a "clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work".</p><p>Bosch - based in Germany - said it had confidence in the "long-term potential" of the North American market and would continue to expand its business there.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund said it was not projecting a US recession, but warned a trade war could have a "significant adverse effect" on Canada and Mexico's economic outlooks.</p>

    <h1>Town's fears over threat to steelworks' future</h1>

        <p>British Steel is launching a consultation that could result in the closure of Scunthorpe's two blast furnaces, putting up to 2,700 jobs out of a total of 3,500 at risk. BBC News sought reaction from the town.</p><p>Children from a Scunthorpe primary school are being given a lesson on the town's steelmaking at North Lincolnshire Museum, as Sonia Weber rests on a bench outside.</p><p>The youngsters are learning how Scunthorpe and the surrounding villages of Ashby, Brumby, Crosby and Frodingham grew rapidly following the discovery of iron ore here in 1859.</p><p>Outside, Ms Weber, 65, the daughter of a German immigrant who came to work in the Lincolnshire town's steelworks after World War Two, says she fears for their future.</p><p>"So many people, so many families – the children – are going to suffer," she says, gesturing towards the museum's front doors. "The works have been here for many, many years."</p><p>Among the museum's exhibits are maps from 1889, 1908 and 1938. The area's growth is clear.</p><p>The future is less so.</p><p>Earlier, British Steel said theblast furnaces were "no longer financially sustainable"due to tough market conditions, the imposition of tariffs and higher environmental costs.</p><p>The BBC understands British Steel was expecting a £1bn injection of government money to keep the business going, but was instead offered £500m.</p><p>"My father, Hans, was very proud to work at the steelworks," says Ms Weber, telling of her own connection with the works, which loom over the town.</p><p>"He was a strong man. It was a very difficult job. A dangerous job."</p><p>An engraved, heptagonal shield commemorating the loss of 11 men in an incident involving the town's Queen Victoria blast furnace on 4 November 1975 is testimony to that.</p><p>Like many, Ms Weber – who grew up hearing stories of blood, sweat and tears – is dismayed at the news.</p><p>It is hard to find anyone in Scunthorpe without a link, past or present, to the steelworks.</p><p>"I have friends who work there," says Kiran Hotchin, 23, a father-of-two. "Scunthorpe is known for its steelworks.</p><p>"A lot of jobs are at stake. I expect a lot of people here are going to end up losing their homes."</p><p>There are nods to steelmaking everywhere. Even the shopping centre is called The Foundry.</p><p>Kelly Christmas, 29, a support worker at the town's hospital, says her mother and stepfather were both employed as cleaners at the works.</p><p>"Wow, that's a lot of people," she tells me, responding to the expected job losses. "It's going to be awful for people, especially those with kids."</p><p>Her friend Sean Robinson, 44, adds: "Scunthorpe is going to be like a ghost town. Nobody care about us. The government is talking about getting people off benefits but 2,500 people could be out of work soon."</p><p>Ayanda Nyongwana, 43, arrived in the town from South Africa a year ago, and he says the looming towers and chimneys of the steelworks immediately made an impression.</p><p>"Scunthorpe is steelmaking," the support worker tells me, as we walk down the High Street.</p><p>"I believe money circulates, and if 2,500 are going to be out of work that is going to affect a lot of businesses – big and small."</p><p>Others, though, appear nonchalant.</p><p>Shane Kirk, 51, owns a garage in the shadow of the works.</p><p>"That place has been closing for the past 30 years," he says, between mouths of lasagne. "But it's still open. They just keep cutting back and cutting back. Quite a few companies round here rely on the steelworks."</p><p>Tom Kirkby, 76, agrees there is "a lot of disillusionment" in the town, with many people seeing wave after wave of job cuts over recent decades.</p><p>"There used to be a lot of good, well-paid jobs here," he says. "I can see people leaving Scunthorpe to find work elsewhere."</p><p>Back in the museum, glass cabinets display physical, personal links to those who helped build the town. Among them are a pair of brown size-10 boots, complete with a completed British Steel Corporation "application to purchase safety footwear" receipt.</p><p>Ms Weber says no-one has any idea who will fill the boots if the shutters come down on the works for good.</p><p>Listen to highlights fromLincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch thelatest episode of Look Northor tell us about a story you think we should be coveringhere.</p>

        <p>Sky has said 2,000 call centre jobs are at risk under plans to move more of its customer service online.</p><p>The media and telecoms company plans to close three of its 10 UK customer service centres, it said on Thursday, citing changing consumer preferences and declining call volumes.</p><p>The planned cuts - which would see its Stockport, Sheffield and Leeds Central call centres close - represent 7% of its total workforce and are subject to consultation.</p><p>A Sky spokesman said it was making a multi-million pound investment in its Livingston site, near Edinburgh, as part of a transformation "to deliver quicker, simpler and more digital customer service".</p><p>As well as closing three sites, operations at its Dunfermline and Newcastle sites would also be affected by the plans.</p><p>Sky News reports that the company, which is owned by Comcast, receives around 25 million calls a year from customers across Europe each year - though it expects this to decrease by a third in the next few years.</p><p>Sky says that many customers now want different means of contacting them - including via online chat and emails - and to be able to contact them 24 hours a day.</p><p>As well as upgrading its Livingston site, the company said it would invest in "cutting-edge digital technology to make our service seamless, reliable, and available 24/7".</p><p>The Sky spokesman said: "This is about building a future-ready Sky that continues to put our customers and their needs first."</p><p>In January 2024, Sky said it was planning to cut 1,000 jobs in the UK as it moved towards more internet-based services.</p>

        <p>The grandparents of Emile Soleil have been released without charge, two days after they were arrested over the toddler's disappearance and death in the French Alps in July 2023.</p><p>Philippe Vedovini and his wife, Anne, were among four people detained earlier this week on suspicion of murder and concealment of a corpse.</p><p>The other two, both adult children of the couple, were also released without charge on Thursday morning, prosecutor Jean-Luc Blachon confirmed.</p><p>Mr Blachon also revealed for the first time that investigators now believe Emile's clothes and remains were transported to the woods where they were found shortly before their discovery last spring.</p><p>Mr Blachon added that analysis of the toddler's skull showed traces of "violent facial trauma" which made it probable that a third party had been involved in Emile's disappearance and death.</p><p>Until Thursday, one of investigators' working theories was that Emile may have wandered off by himself and died as a result of a fall.</p><p>The four people who were taken into custody on Tuesday were released after answering all the questions put to them by investigators, Mr Blachon said, though he added that the line of investigation centred around Emile's family members was not yet fully closed.</p><p>"We continue to be determined to shed light on the circumstances around Emile's death," Mr Blachon said.</p><p>Under French law, people can be placed under arrest for questioning for a set number of hours until police decide whether they may have been involved in a crime.</p><p>Emile's grandmother's lawyer, Julien Pinelli, said that Mrs Vedovini was now resting. "It's been a tense and trying 48 hours," he said.</p><p>"In an investigation of this kind... it is customary to try and rule some things out. The family [angle] was one of the lines of inquiry, it's what prompted the custody and I hope it can now be put to the side."</p><p>The last sighting of Emile was on 8 July 2023, when two neighbours saw him walking by himself on the only street in the tiny Alpine hamlet Haut-Vernet, where he was staying at his grandparents' holiday home.</p><p>Emile, who was then two-and-a-half years old, disappeared without a trace shortly after. Hundreds of people joined police, sniffer dogs and the military in a search the following day, but the toddler appeared to have vanished into thin air.</p><p>It was not until March 2024 that Emile's remains were found only 1km away from the village by a hiker who was said to have made the find while walking in a steep, wooded area that was not easy to access.</p><p>The toddler's disappearance and death shocked France, where the case continues to make headlines.</p>

    <h1>Premier League to have two summer transfer windows due to Club World Cup</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca (left) and Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola could use the earlier window to sign players for the Club World Cup</p><p>The Premier League has announced it will have two transfer windows this summer to allow Manchester City and Chelsea to sign players before the Club World Cup.</p><p>The window will open between Sunday, 1 June and Tuesday, 10 June, then close for five days before running again from Monday, 16 June until Monday, 1 September.</p><p>This summer features the first expanded Fifa Club World Cup, which involves 32 teams and adopts the format of the regular World Cup of the past few years.</p><p>Chelsea and Manchester City are the Premier League teams in the tournament which takes place in the United States from Sunday, 15 June.</p><p>But the Premier League can only have 12 weeks of a summer window - hence the five-day break in order to run it until 1 September.</p><p>Fifa has allowed new players to be registered for the Club World Cup from 1-10 June, and again from 27 June-3 July for the knockout stage.</p><p>Firstly, to bring order to the global registration system, world governing body Fifa only permits the transfer window in any individual country to be open for 16 weeks in any calendar year.</p><p>In Europe, precedent dictates four of those weeks are for the winter window, leaving 12 in the summer. In 2024, the Premier League transfer window opened on 14 June and closed on 30 August.</p><p>However, in October, Fifa approved an additional window from 1-10 June that would allow the 32 clubs competing in the Club World Cup to register new players before the tournament.</p><p>It also agreed to open a registration window mid-tournament, from 27 June and 3 July, to allow clubs to register additional players for the knockout stage.</p><p>As well as Manchester City and Chelsea, European heavyweights Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan, Juventus, Paris St-Germain, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Saudi Arabia's Al-Hilal are among others playing in the tournament.</p><p>In order to ensure Manchester City and Chelsea did not have an advantage over the other 18 top-flight clubs, the Premier League has adopted the same window.</p><p>However, 12 weeks from 1 June is 24 August. The Premier League wanted to be aligned with the rest of Europe's big leagues around when the summer window closes. Those leagues preferred to close the window at the end of August, so that meant the window had to close and reopen.</p><p>Firstly, the dates.</p><p>The Champions League final takes place in Munich on 31 May. After that, there are Nations League semi-finals and finals and World Cup qualifying double-headers. In Europe, those games take place 6-10 June.</p><p>It means players could be negotiating transfers in the build-up to important matches.</p><p>One potential impact concerns international players who may move to clubs competing in the Club World Cup.</p><p>Let us take two examples - Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kevin de Bruyne. Both are internationals who might be called up by England and Belgium for their June matches.</p><p>However, both are out of contract at Liverpool and Manchester City respectively on 30 June.</p><p>Alexander-Arnold currently plays for a club not involved in the United States this summer, butlooks likely to join Real Madrid who are.</p><p>So, do Real reach an agreement over a fee with Liverpool to trigger Alexander-Arnold's release early so he can play a full part in the competition? Or do they wait until 30 June and add him to their squad for the knockout stage?</p><p>Manchester City are involved in the Club World Cup. So, as it presently stands, De Bruyne could play in the group stage but would not be eligible for the knockout stage.</p><p>If De Bruyne does not want to commit for a further year, he could sign a short extension that covers the tournament and then leave. Or he could leave before the tournament and sign for a different club. If that club were also involved at the Club World Cup, De Bruyne would be in the same situation as Alexander-Arnold.</p><p>Fifa has also tweaked its registration rules to effectively mean clubs can sign players solely for the duration of the tournament. It is thought unlikely either Manchester City or Chelsea would be looking at that scenario.</p><p>Man City and Chelsea could earn £97m at Club World Cup</p><p>How does the new Club World Cup work & why is it so controversial?</p><p>How clubs kept to spending rules & what next?</p><p>Semi-automated offside technologymight be introduced to the Premier League in April.</p><p>It was trialled in the FA Cup fifth round - and will be tried again for the three quarter-final ties at Premier League grounds this weekend.</p><p>The plan was to introduce it for the Premier League in October or November, but issues with the system have delayed that.</p><p>If no problems arise from these FA Cup games, it will be rolled out in the Premier League next week.</p><p>Semi-automated offsides are designed to make the judgement of tight calls easier for officials by rendering key parts of the process automatic.</p><p>Bespoke cameras have been installed at all 20 Premier League grounds.</p><p>In the last round of the FA Cup there was a record eight-minute VAR stoppage during Bournemouth's win against Wolves when officialswere unable to rely on the new technologybecause of a congested penalty area.</p><p>What are semi-automated offsides, and how do they work?</p><p>Officials 'unable to rely on' technology during eight-minute stoppage</p><p>Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast</p><p>Get football news sent straight to your phone</p>

        <p>Western sanctions on Russia need to be increased, not weakened, in order to bring it to the negotiating table, Sir Keir Starmer has said.</p><p>The prime minister accused Vladimir Putin of "playing games and playing for time" after the Russian president demanded sanctions were lifted before a US-brokeredmaritime ceasefireis enacted.</p><p>"Now is not the time for pulling back or weakening sanctions - now is the time to increase sanctions to get them to the table," Starmer said in Paris, where he is meeting European leaders.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron, co-hosting Thursday's so-called "coalition of the willing" summit, has suggested a European reassurance force could "respond" if attacked by Moscow.</p><p>Starmer said on Thursday a "framework and a deadline" was needed for Ukraine peace talks.</p><p>He said he had agreed with partners at the summit, which hosted representatives from 30 nations as well as the European Union and Nato, that "we must go further now to support the peace process, support Ukraine and increase the pressure on Russia to get serious".</p><p>"It means increasing the economic pressure on Russia, accelerating new tougher sanctions, bearing down on Russia's energy revenues, and working together to make this pressure count," he said.</p><p>Starmer said that the political mood to find a just and lasting peace in Ukraine was "stronger and broader" than it had ever been, adding that "Europe as a whole has not been this strong and united in a long time".</p><p>The UK will chair the next meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact group, comprised of dozens of countries, to deliver further military aid and "keep Ukraine in the fight", Starmer said.</p><p>The prime minister said defence chiefs from the UK, France and Germany would also be meeting in Ukraine, but did not specify a date.</p><p>Speaking with Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier, Starmer accused Russia of "continuing to inflict devastating attacks on the Ukrainian people" and said Putin's promises were "hollow".</p><p>Zelensky said that everybody at the meeting understood "that Russia doesn't want any kind of peace", and that they would discuss security guarantees in the coming weeks and days.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking the terms of a separate, tentative deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure.</p><p>Washington announced the Black Sea deal had been agreed on Tuesday, after holding separate talks with delegations from Ukraine and Russia in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>But just hours later, the Kremlin said it would not take effect until sanctions were lifted on Russian banks, producers and exporters involved in the international food and fertiliser trades.</p><p>Moscow's demands include reconnecting Russian banks involved in the agrifood trade to the Swift payment system, lifting restrictions on servicing ships under the Russian flag involved in the food trade, and revoking sanctions on the supply of agricultural machinery and other goods involved in food production.</p><p>US President Donald Trump said the US government was "looking at" Moscow's request - but the EU said it would not consider removing sanctions before the "unconditional" withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine's internationally-recognised territory.</p><p>Zelensky said on Wednesday hehoped the US - which is not a part of the coalition of the willing - would "stand strong"in the face of Russian demands.</p><p>Macron confirmed that European countries had "unanimously agreed" that sanctions against Moscow should not be lifted.</p><p>"The time is not ripe to lift sanctions... We need to keep economic pressure up," he said.</p><p>The French president said that if a European force protecting a ceasefire in Ukraine came under attack, it would "respond to it".</p><p>"If there was again a generalised aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would be under attack, and then it's our usual framework of engagement," he said.</p><p>"Our soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it."</p><p>The UK and France are leading efforts to send a force to Ukraine to deter any future Russian aggression in the event of a ceasefire.</p><p>Starmer reiterated on Thursday that Parliament should have a say on deploying troops.</p><p>European leaders put on a show of unity in Paris. In reality many have already ruled out sending troops to Ukraine.</p><p>Countries including Finland and Poland feel under direct threat from Russia and feel their troops need to protect their own borders. Others fear deploying soldiers would be a deeply unpopular decision at home.</p><p>Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – who has repeatedly expressed her scepticism at the Franco-British plan – has been working to put forward an "alternative" option which would see soldiers serve in Ukraine exclusively as part of a United Nations military contingent.</p><p>European officials say that under any peace settlement, Ukraine's first line of defence against any future Russian attack would be its own army.</p><p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said a European force in Ukraine would risk a "direct clash between Russia and Nato", state-owned news agency Tass reports.</p><p>"London and Paris continue to nurture the idea of a military intervention into Ukraine. All of that is being cloaked under [the guise of] a certain peacekeeping mission," Zakharova said.</p><p>She added Russia was "categorically against such a scenario".</p>

        <p>Fashion retailer H&M is to use artificial intelligence (AI) to create digital "twins" of 30 models.</p><p>It says it will use the AI doppelgangers in some social media posts and marketing in the place of humans, if given permission by models.</p><p>"We are curious to explore how to showcase our fashion in new creative ways – and embrace the benefits of new technology – while staying true to our commitment to personal style," said its chief creative officer Jörgen Andersson in a statement.</p><p>Despite H&M's claim it would not change its "human-centric approach" some fear the move could impact other models, photographers and make-up artists.</p><p>American influencer Morgan Riddle called H&M's move "shameful" in a post on her Instagram stories.</p><p>"RIP to all the other jobs on shoot sets that this will take away," she posted.</p><p>The Swedish fashion giant, which also operates Arket, Cos, Monki, & Other Stories and Weekday, says it has more than 4,000 stores worldwide across 75 markets.</p><p>The initiative was first reported byindustry publication Business of Fashion.</p><p>H&M told the outlet that models would retain rights over their digital replicas and their use by the company and other brands for purposes such as marketing.</p><p>Its images are likely to be initially used in social media posts, with watermarks that make their AI use clear, it added.</p><p>Platforms like Instagram and TikTok require users to disclose the use of AI to create realistic content, and it is labelled as such to inform audiences.</p><p>H&M also said models would be compensated for use of their digital twins in a similar way to current arrangements - which sees them paid for use of their images based on rates agreed by their agent.</p><p>Paul W Fleming, general secretary of trade union Equity - which represents fashion models in the UK - said models having full control over their likeness and fair pay for its use was "vital".</p><p>"Whilst we support brands who appear to be moving in this direction, this must be backed up by the widespread adoption of AI protections in union agreements and legislation that protects workers' rights," he told the BBC.</p><p>Equity, like many other trade unions representing performers and creatives,has been campaigning for better protections for workersamid an explosion of AI-generated content and initiatives online.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the current landscape has little to no such protections," Mr Fleming added, citing mass, illegal scraping of their model members' work by big tech and AI developers without their consent.</p><p>Fashion firms including Hugo Boss and Levi Strauss & Co have also dabbled in using generative AI for product images.</p><p>Denim giant Levi'ssaid in 2023it would trial the use of AI-generated model images as a way to "increase diversity".</p><p>Following criticism, it clarified it would not scale back live photoshoots with models.</p><p>Generative AI can create photo-realistic images in response to simple text prompts at high speed and low cost.</p><p>Because of this, it has been seized upon by many industries and firms as a way to meet demands for content such as marketing material.</p><p>But its use by fashion and beauty brands has sparked backlash amid concerns its increased adoption could reduce job opportunities.</p><p>Some fear it may lead to less work for production staff on photoshoots, including photographers, stylists, make-up artists and lighting assistants.</p><p>The company says it is working with Swedish tech firm Uncut on the development of the model's AI likenesses.</p><p>Uncut says on its website it is "helping big brands say goodbye to outdated production methods" and making content creation "simpler, smarter and more affordable".</p><p>For some models, however, having a so-called "AI twin" can allow themto take on more work and avoid travel.</p><p>"She's like me, without the jet-lag," said model Mathilda Gvarliani in a H&M image shared with Business of Fashion.</p><p>Mr Fleming, though, told the BBC that models are still "being forced to sign unfair contracts which deny them their rights to ownership and fair compensation".</p><p>"This is an abhorrent violation when all of our likenesses are incredibly personal to each of us," he added.</p>

        <p>Emma Raducanu will move back into the world's top 50 following her Miami Open run</p><p>Emma Raducanu is starting to play like it is 2021.</p><p>The Briton, who won 10 matches in straight sets to clinch the US Open title, had not been able to win more than three in a row until this week’s Miami Open.</p><p>Herrun was endedby world number four Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals, but on Monday Raducanu will return to the world’s top 50 for the first time since September 2022.</p><p>Success has come despite a constantly changing sea of faces in the coaching box and a typically challenging start to the year.</p><p>The 22-year-old has not had a full-time coach since January, but played with great freedom in Miami.</p><p>So what kind of support might Raducanu need to be able to produce form like this on a more consistent basis?</p><p>After the early promise of two Australian Open wins against higher-ranked opponents, Raducanulost heavilyto Iga Swiatek in January before coach Nick Cavaday informed her his health would prevent him from continuing.</p><p>February's spell in the Middle East ended in distressing fashion, as a man who had been following Raducanu around the circuit was evicted from her second-round match and given a restraining order.</p><p>Raducanu appeared rudderless for much of that period, although she was rarely short of support. Her strength and conditioning coach Yutaka Nakamura has barely left her side since starting in early December.</p><p>Roman Kelecic, a coach from her teenage days, helped out in Abu Dhabi. Jane O'Donoghue, a friend and former LTA coach, was in Doha and Dubai. Tom Welsh was drafted in from the Loughborough Academy as a short-term hire for Indian Wells, only for Vladimir Platenik to usurp him by arriving in California for a hastily arranged trial.</p><p>After only two weeks that trial was ended by Raducanu on the eve of her first-round victory in Miami - and a seat offered once again to O’Donoghue and the broadcaster and coach Mark Petchey.</p><p>How 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coach</p><p>Second Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefing</p><p>Petchey coached an 18-year-old Andy Murray for 10 months - during which he won his first ATP title - and trained with Raducanu during the pandemic summer of 2020.</p><p>Those weeks at the National Tennis Centre in London appear to have left quite an impression on Raducanu. There is a mutual respect and rapport between the two.</p><p>O'Donoghue has been a regular confidante for Raducanu, and was the LTA’s national women’s coach until 2019, when she left the sport for pastures new.</p><p>Raducanu trusts them and is able to relax in their company, but they both have day jobs.</p><p>Petchey is in broadcasting - most notably with the Tennis Channel - and O’Donoghue in finance. She is currently on a sabbatical, but there is no suggestion she wants to return to the far less secure world of tennis coaching on a permanent basis.</p><p>Both could offer input but, as things stand, not the type of support Raducanu said she was seeking when speaking to the BBC at Indian Wells.</p><p>"Once I have a structure in place and I can fall back on the process again I will feel very set," she said this month.</p><p>"In the Middle East it was very difficult for me because I didn't really have any direction or structure or which tournaments to play and it was very difficult doing it all on my own.</p><p>"I'm that kind of person who needs a plan and needs preparation. That's what I'm building and that's making me feel more comfortable."</p><p>Jane O'Donoghue (left) was with Emma Raducanu in Miami</p><p>Raducanu is part of the Great Britain team which will compete in the Billie Jean King Cup qualifying round in early April, and will be able to spend the next two weeks working with the LTA coaching team.</p><p>But she will need a more lasting plan swiftly.</p><p>Her clay-court season could take in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome before the French Open, and there will be very little respite in the schedule before the end of October.</p><p>That plan does not need to revolve around one person.</p><p>Many top players employ more than one coach, usually because it is very hard for any one individual to commit to more than 30 weeks on the road each year.</p><p>Jack Draper ended last summer’s partnership with Wayne Ferreira as he preferred the "one voice" of James Trotman, but now travels to some events with Alex Ward.</p><p>Perhaps things could have worked out differently with Cavaday if an additional coach had been brought into the team when his health problems first arose in the spring of 2024.</p><p>Exposure to different personalities and ways of thinking has always been appealing to Raducanu, but the period with Cavaday offered her stability and calmness.</p><p>They liked each other, having first established a coaching partnership when Raducanu was a girl. Cavaday was a good sounding board, and there was evidence from her play last spring and summer that the two could flourish in future.</p><p>Other partnerships fizzled out much more quickly.</p><p>Platenik lasted only two weeks. His coaching acumen is widely admired, but his personality did not seem a good match for Raducanu.</p><p>One former player compared him to a "freight train", saying he was intense and opinionated. Platenik says Raducanu told him she was feeling “stressed” when ending the brief collaboration.</p><p>Torben Beltz looked an excellent choice, given his Grand Slam success with Angelique Kerber, but Raducanu did not feel he had enough to offer.</p><p>Dmitry Tursunov ended their partnership because he thought Raducanu needed to listen to just "one voice". He referred to "red flags" and a feeling there may be further problems down the line.</p><p>Her spell with Sebastian Sachs concluded after operations on both hands and left ankle, which kept her on the sidelines for the second half of 2023.</p><p>There did not seem much logic in dispensing of the services of Nigel Sears after Wimbledon 2021, but it is hard to argue with the choice of Andrew Richardson, who then steered her to that historic triumph at the US Open.</p><p>However, that partnership ended there.</p><p>Would Raducanu go back to a coach she has previously let go? Sears still looks a good bet and has a proven track record of success with Daniela Hantuchova, Ana Ivanovic and Anett Kontaveit.</p><p>He is no longer working with the Australian Olivia Gadecki, and is a regular at the National Tennis Centre in London, where he works with the LTA's women's team.</p><p>For all her progress in Miami, Raducanu may have a difficult spring and summer without the right personnel around her.</p><p>Does she ever throws a covetous glance at Draper's set-up?</p><p>His team looks a thoroughly professional outfit, and some hard decisions have recently been made.</p><p>Physio Will Herbert and strength and conditioning coach Steve Kotze are no longer involved. They have been replaced by Shane Annun and Matt Little, who were so integral to Andy Murray's team.</p><p>And Trotman remains as head coach. He has been working full-time with the new Indian Wells champion since the end of 2021, in which time Draper has risen from outside the top 250 and into the world's top 10.</p>

    <h1>Bowen: Zelensky buoyant, but Europe will struggle to guarantee Ukraine's security</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">BBC News</span>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a buoyant mood when I met him in Paris with a panel of three other European journalists. He had interrupted a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and went back there for what he called a "tête à tête dinner" after the interview.</p><p>Macron had not just rolled out the red carpet for him. The Eiffel Tower, behind Zelensky in a picture window as we talked in one of Paris's great museums, was lit up in yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag.</p><p>The French wanted him to feel as if he was among friends. Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the "coalition of the willing", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire.</p><p>Zelensky's welcome in Paris was a clear contrast to thedressing down he was given by US President Donald Trumpand his vice president JD Vance when he visited the White House last month.</p><p>After their verbal attack, Zelensky was unceremoniously turfed out of the White House and not long afterwards Trump ordered the suspension of American military aid and intelligence to Ukraine.</p><p>It was restored after Zelensky, advised by the British, the French and other European allies, went out of his way to mend his fences with Trump and his administration.</p><p>He switched to the kind of flattering language Trump demands and agreed to an American plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.  He dropped his insistence on US security guarantees first, to underpin any ceasefire.</p><p>But even though US military and intelligence assistance is flowing, Trump's ruthless suspension of it, which cost Ukrainian lives, has left a deep sense of unease in Ukraine and among its European allies.</p><p>The evidence is piling up that Trump's United States is not a reliable ally. It is getting easier to sketch out scenarios in which it might not be an ally at all.</p><p>Most European leaders still try to act publicly as if the 80-year-old alliance with the US is healthy. But the gathering of 30 countries in Paris shows they realise they can no longer rely on the benevolence of the United States.</p><p>American presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s have complained, with good reason, about Europeans getting a free ride from the US security blanket over Europe. Trump has finally pulled it away.</p><p>During the interview, Zelensky praised the array of plans that are being formulated in western Europe – led by the UK, France and Germany – to spend more on defence.</p><p>He suggested that in three to five years, "if everything goes as it is now", Europe might even catch up with the United States.</p><p>At best, that is a highly optimistic estimate, less an accurate forecast and more a gesture of appreciation for European allies who unlike the Americans attach very few conditions and strings to support for Ukraine.</p><p>Europe, Zelensky said, "has discipline and no chaos". That might be seen as an oblique and unflattering comparison with the twists and turns coming out of the Trump White House.</p><p></p><p>I asked him about the conditions Russia's President Vladimir Putin has attached to the latest small step in the Trump peace initiative, which is a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea.</p><p>After Ukraine and Russia held separate meetings with the Americans in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin issued a statement that required concessions as Russia's price for a ceasefire.</p><p>The most significant demand was for a state-owned Russian bank to be readmitted to the Swift system for international payments. That would open a door back into mainstream global commerce for Russia.</p><p>That decision does not depend on Trump, as Swift is based in Belgium.</p><p>The European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the "main preconditions" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was "the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine".</p><p>Even Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be "dragging its feet" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career.</p><p>He told the US cable channel Newsmax that "I've done it over the years… I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game."</p><p></p><p>I asked Zelensky where the push for a ceasefire stood, given Russia's demands. He called for a resolute response from the Americans.</p><p>"If America is going to stand strong and not bend to the conditions of the Russians - we stand on our land.</p><p>"We are defending it; we have shown our resilience to everyone… And now it's very important that our partners would be resilient and strong, at least at the minimum, as we are."</p><p>I asked whether he believed the Americans would, as he put it, stay strong.</p><p>"I hope so. I hope so. God bless they will. But we'll see."</p><p>Zelensky has no choice about stating his faith in Trump's America, even though he must have grave doubts.</p><p>Trump's decision to punish Ukraine by cutting off military intelligence about Russia missile launches had an immediate and deadly impact, and Zelensky had to work hard to get Trump to relent. He does not want it to happen again.</p><p>He was open about why he had to try to stay close to Trump, even as the US president seemed to be prioritising the restoration of relations with Moscow as he repeated Russian propaganda points, not least the lie that Ukraine started the war.</p><p>"We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important."</p><p></p><p>That did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war.</p><p>In an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the "coalition of the willing" to support Ukraine.</p><p>The American said it was a posture and pose, "a simplistic desire" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States.</p><p>What if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries.</p><p>Zelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda.</p><p>"I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives… I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives."</p><p>Zelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan.</p><p>"He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different."</p><p></p><p>President Zelensky, for a man who has lived with immense pressure since Russia's full scale invasion more than three years ago, was remarkably buoyant, clearly pleased by the reception he had in Paris and the efforts that President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer are making to rally European support and to persuade, even cajole,  Trump not to cut intelligence and military support to Ukraine.</p><p>Zelensky seemed happy with his new strategy of agreeing to temporary ceasefires to force Putin to show his reluctance to pause the war.</p><p>I asked Zelensky how he was dealing with the pressure. His goal, he said, was for his children to be able "to walk down the street and not have to hide." And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people.</p><p>"He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears."</p><p>Zelensky laughed.</p><p>"And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin."</p><p>Trump might be hoping for a deal by Easter. Zelensky is still looking to the long haul.</p>

    <h1>Six things that could get more expensive for Americans under Trump tariffs</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.</p><p>The tariffs apply to steel and aluminium imported to the US, as well as to some other products from Mexico, Canada and China - prompting announcements of counter-measures from the latter two countries and the European Union.</p><p>Trump has also announced tariffs on cars coming into the US which are due to come into effect on 3 April. Tariffs on certain car parts are set to start in May or later.</p><p>Economists have warned these tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers.</p><p>That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.</p><p>So which things could become more expensive?</p><p>The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (£186bn) in trade.</p><p>Many US car companies also have operations in Mexico and Canada, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between them.</p><p>Component parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.</p><p>The new tariffs on car parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt for now while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties.</p><p>Anderson Economic Group has estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by roughly $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle.</p><p>The cost of the higher taxes is likely to be passed on to customers.</p><p>Andrew Foran from TD Economics has said that disrupting trade flows through tariffs "would come with significant costs".</p><p>He argues that the "uninterrupted free trade" which has "existed for decades" in the car-making sector has lowered prices for consumers.</p><p>Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.</p><p>However, it's also possible that firms could decide to bring in less foreign beer.</p><p>Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.</p><p>The picture is more complicated when it comes to spirits, which have been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s.</p><p>Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were "deeply concerned".</p><p>They argue that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are "recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries".</p><p>So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises.</p><p>The bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in the US, Canada and Mexico.</p><p>The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.</p><p>Trump has said the US has "more lumber than we ever use".</p><p>However, the National Association of Home Builders urged the president to exempt building materials "because of their harmful effect on housing affordability".</p><p>The industry group has "serious concerns" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.</p><p>"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices," the NAHB said.</p><p>Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.</p><p>On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.</p><p>Findings are due towards the end of 2025.</p><p>The "most obvious" household impact of a trade war with Canada would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.</p><p>Canada's billion-dollar industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.</p><p>The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.</p><p>"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face," Mr Sampson said.</p><p>"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up," he added.</p><p>Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.</p><p>According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.</p><p>While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.</p><p>The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called "heavier" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.</p><p>"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production," according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.</p><p>That means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices.</p><p>Avocados thrive in in the Mexican climate.</p><p>Nearly90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.</p><p>The US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.</p><p>Related dishes like guacamole could also become more expensive.</p><p>Additional reporting by Lucy Acheson</p>

    <h1>BBC's Mark Lowen deported from Turkey after covering protests</h1>

        <p>BBC correspondent Mark Lowen has been deported from Turkey after being arrested in Istanbul on Wednesday, the BBC has said.</p><p>Lowen had been in Turkey for several days to report on the ongoing protests that were sparked by the Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu's arrest last week.</p><p>Imamoglu - who is being held in jail on corruption charges he denies - is seen as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival.</p><p>He has been selected by his party as presidential candidate in the 2028 election.</p><p>In a statement issued on Thursday, the BBC said: "This morning (27 March) the Turkish authorities deported BBC News correspondent Mark Lowen from Istanbul, having taken him from his hotel the previous day and detained him for 17 hours."</p><p>On Thursday morning, he was presented with a written notice that he was being deported for "being a threat to public order," the statement said.</p><p>Mark Lowen said: "To be detained and deported from the country where I previously lived for five years and for which I have such affection has been extremely distressing. Press freedom and impartial reporting are fundamental to any democracy."</p><p>The BBC's CEO of News Deborah Turness added: "This is an extremely troubling incident and we will be making representations to the Turkish authorities.</p><p>"Mark is a very experienced correspondent with a deep knowledge of Turkey and no journalist should face this kind of treatment simply for doing their job. We will continue to report impartially and fairly on events in Turkey."</p><p>The Turkey director of Human Rights Watch, Emma Sinclair-Webb, told the BBC she was shocked at the deportation of an international journalist.</p><p>"This sends a message to the rest of the international media that 'we will not tolerate you covering stories we don't want the world to see,'" she said.</p><p>Thousands of people across Turkey have turned out for protests which have so far seen more than 1,400 people detained.</p><p>The protesters say Imamoglu's arrest is politically motivated, but the justice ministry insists on its judicial independence.</p><p>President Erdogan has labelled the demonstrations "evil" and blamed the opposition for "disturbing the peace".</p><p>Several journalists have also been arrested, including a photojournalist from French news agency Agence France Presse and several Turkish reporters. Many were reportedly released on Thursday morning.</p><p>Nightly protests have stopped but Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), is planning a rally in Istanbul on Saturday.</p>

        <p>Society's move to cashless payments may have had an unintended positive side effect, surgeons say - fewer children needing operations or procedures to remove swallowed coins.</p><p>The Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) experts looked back over hospital records in England since the Millennium.</p><p>Procedures to remove foreign objects, including coins, from children's throats, airways and noses saw a "significant decline", of almost 700 cases by 2022.</p><p>Historically, coins had accounted for over 75% of objects swallowed by under-sixes, they told a medical journal.</p><p>According to the UK Payments Markets Survey, cards began outstripping cash in 2012.</p><p>And that is when the researchers say a decade-spanning drop in patient cases began.</p><p>But other factors - such as child-proof packaging and safety campaigns - probably also helped reduce cases, especially of objects stuck up the nose.</p><p>Common objects lodged in children's nostrils include beads, pins, baby teeth, screws and food, the researchers say</p><p>Peanuts and peas can sometimes get inhaled and stuck in the airways.</p><p>But concern is shifting towards other potentially dangerous shiny objects, such as button batteries and magnets, which are now sometimes swallowed by children.</p><p>These can cause deadly complications within hours and need urgent medical attention, Akash Jangan and colleagues say in The Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.</p><p>Anopen-access web versionmade available in June 2024 shows, from 2012-22:</p><p>ENT surgeon Mr Ram Moorthy, who was not involved in the study but is a member of Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: "It is positive that fewer children are swallowing coins.</p><p>"This study shows how new technology can make children safer in ways we didn't intend - but there are still hazardous items to be aware of.</p><p>"As doctors, we still worry about other dangerous items, such as button batteries and magnets, that can really cause harm.</p><p>"We must continue to make sure that small items like this are not within a child's reach."</p><p>Removing foreign objects from ears and noses costs NHS hospitals in England around £3m a year,according to datafor 2010 to 2016.</p><p>Children were responsible for the vast majority of cases - 95% of objects removed from noses and 85% from ears.</p><p>In adults, cotton buds are thought to be the leading problem.</p>

        <p>Ukrainians in the UK are losing out on job opportunities and homes because of uncertainty over how long they will be allowed to stay in the country.</p><p>They were initially given the right to live and work in the UK for three years and can apply for an 18-month extension 28 days before their original visa expires. The government said this provided "certainty and security".</p><p>But some Ukrainians have told the BBC that employers are reluctant to hire them or landlords will not rent to them because their visa is due to expire.</p><p>One survey of 1,133 Ukrainians in Britain suggested 41% had lost a new job opportunity because of visa uncertainty, while 26% said their tenancy was not renewed.</p><p>Researchers from the University of Birmingham also found 22% of respondents said a job contract was not renewed, while 24% said they could not sign a new tenancy.</p><p>Arrivals spiked after the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows people in the UK to host those fleeing the war, was launched on 14 March 2022.</p><p>At the peak in May that year, more than 10,000 Ukrainians a week came, with a total of 300,000 offered sanctuary to date, according to the Home Office.</p><p>People were initially given the right to stay for three years, meaning the bulk of visas are due to expire in the coming months. The Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme opened on 18 February.</p><p>The government says Ukrainians retain their existing rights to live and work in the UK while a decision is being made on whether to extend their visa, which can take up to eight weeks.</p><p>However, charities say in practice some Ukrainians who are in the process of extending their visa or only have a few months left are struggling to find jobs or rental properties.</p><p>Mila, who lives in Atherstone, Warwickshire, with her 14-year-old daughter, is waiting for her visa extension to be approved.</p><p>The family must leave their flat by 25 April as it is being sold by the landlord.</p><p>She had planned to move to a flat closer to her job at a salon in Nuneaton but the agent told her she could not sign a six-month tenancy because her visa is due to expire on 12 April.</p><p>Mila said she had tried a number of different agents without success because of her visa status.</p><p>She told the BBC she was worried about the prospect of being left without anywhere to live, adding: "I can't sleep at night."</p><p>Tatiana - not her real name - struggled to find a new job after her contract as a lab technician ended, despite being highly qualified.</p><p>Over a six-month period she says she wasrefused for around six jobs because her visa was due to expire in July, with prospective employers citing uncertainty over whether her right to work in the UK would be extended.</p><p>One company asked her to apply for a visa extension immediately, but she was unable to because of rules stating applications can only be made 28 days before the original visa expires.</p><p>Tatiana, who has two sons aged 11 and 16, told the BBC the situation left her suffering from anxiety, for which she was prescribed medication by her GP.</p><p>Although she has now secured a new job, Tatiana still feels worried about her future.</p><p>"It's incredibly frustrating to feel trapped in this cycle," she said.</p><p>"[My employer] would love to offer a longer-term position, but the visa situation prevents it.</p><p>"We are all in a tough position, and I wish we had at least some certainty about the future."</p><p>Olena - not her real name - arrived in the UK with her daughter, who is now 15, in April 2022 and their visas have recently expired.</p><p>She applied for an extension more than three weeks before the expiry date but they are still waiting for this to be approved.</p><p>Olena is a housekeeper at a hotel but her employer initially told her she could not work after her visa expires and would have to take annual leave.</p><p>She also receives universal credit as she can only work limited hours due to health problems. With her visa due to expire, her caseworkers wrote to her warning her benefits could be stopped, causing her further anxiety.</p><p>Rights to claim benefits remain while a visa decision is pending,according to government guidance.</p><p>Olena was only able to persuade her employer she could continue to work with help from the charity Settled, which also helped her to provide the necessary information to ensure her benefit payments continued.</p><p>Others told the BBC they had been informed by universities they would have to pay international fees as their visa was due to expire before the course began.</p><p>This is despitegovernment guidancestating that those on visa schemes for Ukrainians should be treated as "home" students, who are eligible for financial support and domestic fees.</p><p>Settled said it had also seen an increasing number of technical issues which had left Ukrainians unable to prove their visa status or progress their applications for an extension.</p><p>It said an automatic visa extension would avoid these issues.</p><p>Simone Schehtman, who runs the Birmingham for Ukraine support group, said currently most visa extensions were being approved within a couple of weeks but there was concern that in the coming months the volume of applications could overwhelm the system.</p><p>"We've got about 100,000 Ukrainians about to submit their [extension application]," said Ms Schehtman. "It's a complete disaster."</p><p>A government spokesperson said: "We are fully committed to supporting Ukraine in its fight against Putin's illegal war, while also providing a safe and secure haven for those fleeing the conflict."</p><p>The spokesperson added that the visa extension scheme allowed "a continuation of rights to work, live and study as well as access to healthcare and welfare support in the UK".</p><p>Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        <p>Chelsea are into the Women's Champions League semi-finals for a third successive year</p><p>Barcelona next? "Bring it on."</p><p>That was the response from Chelsea captain Millie Bright after her side booked a third successive semi-final meeting with the Spanish giants in the Women's Champions League.</p><p>Belief is rife in the Chelsea squad and it was on show in abundance as they swept aside Manchester City in a ruthless display at Stamford Bridgeto overturn a first-leg deficit.</p><p>Sonia Bompastor's side had work to do having come away from Manchester trailing 2-0 in the tie - but one thing this Chelsea side know how to do is win.</p><p>"We were never in doubt. We had full confidence in ourselves. We could have had way more than three goals," said Bright.</p><p>"[We have an] unbelievable mentality and desire to come back. It was a true Chelsea performance.</p><p>"We are a new team, we are on a new journey, we are in a new era. Bring it on."</p><p>All-English Champions League final on cards as last four confirmed</p><p>'A magical high in rollercoaster Arsenal campaign'</p><p>Get the latest WSL news on our dedicated page</p><p>Sonia Bompastor is bidding to become the first Chelsea manager to win the Women's Champions League</p><p>Chelsea's hunt for European glory has been halted by Barcelona in successive seasons - but this year the Blues have an added incentive.</p><p>A quadruple is on the cards with Chelsea having already won the Women's League Cup, while they are eight points clear at the top of the Women's Super League and into the Women's FA Cup semi-finals.</p><p>"The quadruple mentality is back on," former Chelsea midfielder Karen Carney said on TNT Sports.</p><p>"They are not stopping, they are a train and when they are on it, you can't stop them. They will be thinking 'we want that quadruple and we are not going to stop'."</p><p>Bompastor says she is not allowing herself to think about a four-trophy haul, but Chelsea's ambitions are clear - and the way they dispatched City on Thursday suggests they are up to the challenge.</p><p>"We had all the belief coming into this game that we were capable of turning it around," Bright told BBC Sport.</p><p>"We were fully confident and [knew we] just needed to be ruthless. It was a true Chelsea performance. The fans were incredible.</p><p>"It's all about the mentality and belief and everyone stepping up and delivering."</p><p>Chelsea were far superior in every department, with Sandy Baltimore, Nathalie Bjorn and Mayra Ramirez on the scoresheet in an explosive first-half display.</p><p>They pressed City intensely and finished clinically to take an aggregate lead, but could have added more to their tally with Bjorn and Erin Cuthbert hitting the woodwork, while Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Ramirez missed further chances.</p><p>"This is the Chelsea we know, this is the Chelsea that just get it done. It was about energy, hunger, desire," said former Blues striker Eni Aluko.</p><p>"The quadruple is important, but the Champions League is the one that has eluded them.</p><p>"Even if they don't do the quadruple, if they win the Champions League, that will be the one the players have tried to do for years.</p><p>"The owners brought Bompastor in because she has done it."</p><p>Chelsea have won six of their past seven home games against Man City across all competitions</p><p>To finally win the Champions League, Chelsea will have to get past a Barca side who have ended their European dream in three of the past four seasons.</p><p>The Catalans won 4-0 in the 2021 final and then knocked Chelsea out in the semi-finals in 2023 and 2024 on the way to lifting the trophy.</p><p>Those painful memories, along with Bompastor's defeats against Barcelona while manager at Lyon, will act as added motivation next month.</p><p>But, having added to their squad with the arrivals of USA defender Naomi Girma and former Barcelona midfielder Keira Walsh, is this finally Chelsea's year?</p><p>"We'll do everything possible to make that happen but, as you know, Barcelona have a lot of experience and talent in the squad," said Bompastor.</p><p>"In football, everything is possible. I will bring all the confidence we need to go into those two games but first of all we want to enjoy this, because it was not easy."</p><p>Chelsea's victory over City capped off an exhilarating series of four matches in two weeks between the clubs.</p><p>Ultimately, Chelsea's experience and quality in depth shone through and they will hope it carries them all the way to four trophies by the end of May.</p>

    <h1>David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along</h1>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.</p><p>And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.</p><p>This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.</p><p>There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.</p><p>There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.</p><p>That idea was the free market.</p><p>This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.</p><p>If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.</p><p>What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.</p><p>US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.</p><p>It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking if the free market system is fatally flawed and doomed to failure?</p><p>So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.</p><p>But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.</p><p>I was six when the war ended. There was rationing – coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.</p><p>With Clement Atlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.</p><p>But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.</p><p>"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it," was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.</p><p>However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.</p><p>That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.</p><p>Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.</p><p>Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.</p><p>The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.</p><p>In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.</p><p>And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.</p><p>In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of £60bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.</p><p>Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.</p><p>And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.</p><p>There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.</p><p>At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.</p><p>James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.</p><p>But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.</p><p>"You get to a system whereby so as to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.</p><p>"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore."</p><p>Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.</p><p>And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.</p><p>Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?</p><p>Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.</p><p>Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.</p><p>Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, driven by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.</p><p>The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.</p><p>In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.</p><p>What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.</p><p>Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.</p><p>Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.</p><p>President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.</p><p>But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.</p><p>There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.</p><p>Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.</p><p>The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.</p><p>That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.</p><p>BBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        <p>An "unprecedented view" of how the body changes during and after pregnancy has revealed many long-lasting impacts on the liver, kidneys and more</p><p>ByCarissa Wong</p><p>26 March 2025</p><p></p><p>Pregnancy has many effects on the body</p><p>AnnaStills/Getty Images</p><p></p><p>As anyone who experiences it knows, pregnancy vastly transforms the body – and now we have the most detailed picture yet of how it affects the blood, organs and immune system on a weekly basis. This could help provide treatments post-pregnancy, as well as reveal the risks of developing certain conditions while pregnant.</p><p>“We got an unprecedented view of the way the mother’s body is changing week by week, to compensate for the incredible load on it, and how long it takes to recover after delivery,” saysUri Alonat the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>The only four skincare ingredients that have been proven to work</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Despite its importance, pregnancy has been understudied, says Alon. For example, previous research has tracked how around 20 blood markers, such as salt and iron levels, changein dozens of women during pregnancy up to roughly 6 weeksafter delivery, using samples taken during standard healthcare. “These experiments are usually done on a small number of patients, and they sample just once every trimester or one time point after delivery,” says Alon.</p><p>To get a more comprehensive view, Alon and his colleagues analysed blood samples previously collected from more than 160,000 women in Israel, aged between 25 and 31, who collectively had over 300,000 pregnancies. Together, these samples provided a snapshot of the body each week from 20 weeks before conception to 18 months after delivery, with each woman providing data for a few points in time. This approach gives useful insights into how the body generally changes during pregnancy at a population level, though tracking the same women at every time point would provide a better picture of individual trajectories, saysChristoph Leesat Imperial College London.</p><p>The researchers mapped out changes in 76 blood markers, such as the levels of proteins, fats and salts, that indicate the function of the liver, kidneys, blood, muscles, bones and immune system. They found that each of these markers varied widely from pre-conception levels during pregnancy, before either gradually returning to pre-pregnancy levels or overshooting the other way before settling back to the pre-pregnancy baseline.</p><p>Get the most essential health and fitness news in your inbox every Saturday.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>The remarkable science-backed ways to get fit as fast as possible</p><p></p><p>Notably, the scientists found that while 36 of the markers, including those related to blood clotting, bounced back within a month after delivery, 31 markers took more than 10 weeks to recover. For instance, some changes to the liver and immune system took around 5 months to return to pre-pregnancy levels, and several kidney markers took roughly half a year. Some bone and muscle markers took even longer. What exactly this means for women’s health is unclear, but it should be explored in future work, says Alon.</p><p>What’s more, a few other markers never returned to baseline levels, even over a year after birth. “The slightly old-fashioned view that by six or eight weeks after pregnancy, everyone’s completely back to normal, is clearly wrong,” says Lees.</p><p>For instance, iron levels remained low long after giving birth. “Women are quite likely to be anaemic [have low iron levels] after delivery because of haemorrhaging, and because a developing foetus takes a lot of the iron stores out of their bodies,” says Lees. “We typically think it takes six to 12 months for iron stores to get back to normal – this suggests it might take even longer.”</p><p>Meanwhile, levels of a protein called CRP stayed high. “CRP is affected by a number of different processes, certainly inflammation is one of them, but things like hormonal changes can also affect this,” says Lees. In another analysis, the team looked at markers in women who had pre-eclampsia – a condition during pregnancy where high blood pressure can cause headaches, vision problems and pre-term birth, and lead to fatal complications for both mother and baby if left untreated. This revealed that, before conception, women who developed pre-eclampsia had elevated levels of blood cell fragments called platelets and a protein called ALT, compared to those who did not develop the condition.</p><p></p><p>We’re finally learning how perimenopause profoundly changes the brain</p><p>The hormonal upheaval in the run-up to menopause can cause cognitive difficulties. But researchers are also finding that this can be a critical window for protecting long-term brain health</p><p></p><p>“For decades, the idea has been that the placenta doesn’t implant properly, and if it doesn’t implant properly, the blood supply is disrupted, it releases hormones and substances that lead to the mother getting high blood pressure,” says Lees. “But some studies suggest that those who develop it have a different cardiovascular function before pregnancy – these findings add weight to this theory.”</p><p>If further studies show that these pre-conception markers really do indicate the risk of pre-eclampsia, they could potentially be used to pinpoint women at high risk. “Then you could target them with ways of improving health prior to pregnancy – either through exercise and lifestyle advice – to lower their risk,” says Lees.</p><p></p><p>Journal reference:</p><p>Science AdvancesDOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adr7922</p><p></p><p>Topics:</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>From race and IQ to sex and gender, Herman Pontzer's new book Adaptable is an ambitious and enjoyable exploration of how understanding ourselves better can help us bridge divides</p><p>ByMichael Le Page</p><p>26 March 2025</p><p>ByMichael Le Page</p><p>The racial divide in track events is down to factors other than genetics</p><p>Hannah Peters/Getty Images</p><p>AdaptableHerman Pontzer (Allen Lane)</p><p>Fancy eating the real paleo diet? Rotten meat should be top of your menu, preferably with a generous helping of maggots. Dietary records “from every continent and climate are alive with maggots, worms and the soft, smelly flesh of decaying animals. Many groups preferred rotten meat to fresh,” says evolutionary anthropologist Herman Pontzer. “The more it stank, the better.”</p><p>In fact, we seem to have evolved to eat rotten meat. Our stomachs are much more acidic than most other animals, more like those of vultures than of primates and carnivores, Pontzer writes. But he dismisses the idea of a single paleo diet – our ancestors ate what they could get, which varied hugely and included a lot of carbs.</p><p>This is the least controversial part of his book. Sex and gender, IQ, skin colour, racism, sport, anti-ageing drugs, vaccines, diet, exercise and more are covered inAdaptable: The surprising science of human diversity.</p><p>Early on, Pontzer talks about his research in Kenya with the Daasanach community. Charity workers thought that most of their children were malnourished because they weighed less at a given height than growth charts projected. But when Pontzer’s team crunched the data, it was discovered that these children grow taller faster than average. The Daasanach are just different – taller and leaner, which is likely to help them stay cool in the heat.</p><p>Just as you are wondering where Pontzer is going with this, he explains why the concept of race makes no biological sense. Skin colour varies continuously from dark to light, with no clear dividing point. If we categorised people on other traits, like height, we would end up with very different groups.</p><p>Pontzer, who has giventalks atNew Scientisteventsand whose work hasoften featured in the magazine, is especially dismissive about the use of racial categories in medicine. Any health disparities are due to the environment rather than genetics, such as the stress of racism contributing to higher rates of heart disease.</p><p>There never was a single paleo diet – our ancestors ate what they could get, which would have varied hugely</p><p>Nor do particular “races” have an advantage in certain sports, he explains. “The racial divide in swimming and track comes down to culture, environment and opportunity.”</p><p>As forintelligence, heritability of IQ is “embarrassingly low”, he says, meaning genetics is useless for predicting individual scores. It isn’t possible that differences between groups are genetic, nor is there any reason to expect differences. Selection pressures for intelligence have been the same everywhere. The chances that “melanin-challenged pseudo-intellectuals coddled by modern technology hold any unique alleles for intelligence” seem remote, he writes.</p><p>With the sexes, Pontzer uses an analogy of an island, with two mountainous peaks connected by an isthmus. The peaks seem quite separate from some perspectives; from others, there is no clear divide. To focus on one perspective and dismiss the rest isn’t honest.</p><p>When it comes to the gender people identify as, the evidence suggests both hormone exposure and socialisation play a role: “All we can say… is that biology and socialisation both matter, and that neither on its own determines how we think or who we become.” Advantages in size, strength and endurance conferred by higher testosterone exposure don’t go away when testosterone levels fall, Pontzer writes, so trans women racing in women’s categories “would promote inclusion, but at a substantial cost to fairness”.</p><p>There is something for everyone to disagree with inAdaptable, but the fact that Pontzer has discussed these issues with people who hold a range of views shines through the book. There is a nice line of humour running through it, too.</p><p>This is an ambitious work, and especially relevant in the light of what is happening in the US. Pontzer hopes understanding ourselves better can help bridge divides. “Yes, today’s societal divisions are stark but we now know they’re born from cultural inventions that can change, not from unbridgeable biological differences,” he writes.</p><p>Every “miraculous protein robot”, as Pontzer calls us, should read the book. The less of a science fanatic you are, the more you will get out of it, but even after years of covering much of this territory forNew Scientist, I learned a lot and greatly enjoyed the tour.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>From useful nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus to cellulose for construction, there is treasure to be mined in our sewage, saysGraham Lawton</p><p>ByGraham Lawton</p><p>26 March 2025</p><p>ByGraham Lawton</p><p>“Urine separation is alive and well – along with other ways to recover useful compounds from sewage”</p><p>Rosanna U/Connect Images/Alamy</p><p>Many years ago, I wrote a feature forNew Scientistabout an innovation in waste-water treatment called urine-separation toilets, which, at the time, looked like becoming a desirable accessory for the eco-conscious. To cut a long story short, the Western habit of flushing urine away using clean water then separating it out again in sewage plants is extremely wasteful. Toilets that collect undiluted urine separately and send it off for processing into fertiliser save large amounts of energy and water. We punningly dubbed it“pee-cycling”.</p><p>Urine separation didn’t really get off the ground, and I must admit I had forgotten all about it. That is until I read a review paper in the journalNature Sustainabilitycalled“Pathways to advanced resource recovery from sewage”and discovered that urine separation is alive and well – along with other ways to recover useful compounds from sewage.</p><p>Traditional waste-water treatment focuses primarily on pollution control. Waste water in the form of toilet effluent (known as yellow water and black water) plus grey water from washing machines, baths, showers and sinks enters the system and is cleaned up to drinking water standards. Organic matter is mainly converted into carbon dioxide and nitrogen and vented to the atmosphere, while non-biodegradable material settles out as solid sludge and is sent to landfill or incinerated. This model has performed well in terms of preventing waterborne diseases and protecting the aquatic environment, the authors say, but it is extremely wasteful.</p><p>In recent years, however, a paradigm shift has taken place. Instead of seeing sewage as a waste stream to be managed, it is being re-envisioned as a resource from which valuable products can be extracted. The technology now exists to largely circularise the waste-water system such that every bit of it is reused: sewage treatment plants are increasingly seen not as waste facilities but as chemical factories.</p><p>The first step on the journey to sewage circularity is already here, in the form of what the industry calls NEW factories, where NEW stands for nutrients, energy and water. Water is the easy bit – traditional sewage treatment is already very good at turning a mixture of yellow, black and grey water into the kind we can drink. The energy side is also quite mature. Around 11 per cent of Europe’s sewage treatment plants, according to the paper, use microbial digestion to convert organic material from sewage sludge into biogas, a mix of methane and CO2. This can be burned to generate electricity and heat, both of which can be used to sustain the treatment process.</p><p>Sewage treatment plants are increasingly being seen not as waste facilities but as chemical factories</p><p>Recovery of nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, is more challenging, but increasingly doable. Around 25 per cent of all phosphorus applied to agricultural land as fertiliser eventually finds its way into sewage, according to the paper’s authors. If all of this were recovered and recycled, demand for phosphate rocks – a finite resource that could bedepleted in as little as 70 years– would fall by 15 to 20 per cent. The best way to recover phosphate is by precipitating it out of the sludge, a method that also works for recovering nitrogen.</p><p>Water, energy and nutrients are the low-hanging fruit, and they aren’t very profitable. But sewage also contains much more valuable commodities, which a few forward-thinking treatment plants are already recovering and selling.</p><p>One of those is cellulose, the main component of toilet paper. Around 35 per cent of the solid matter in sewage is cellulose, which usually ends up being buried or burned. But a few plants harvest cellulose from waste, clean it up and sell it to the construction industry. This unlikely market is already worth over $17 billion a year and its value is forecast to more than double by 2032.</p><p>The treatment of sewage also generates biodegradable plastic-like materials, notably polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), which fetch a high price. PHAs can replace polyethylene or polypropylene, while EPSs have replaced non-biodegradable polymers in fertilisers and seed coatings.</p><p>None of this is glamorous, but neither is conventional sewage treatment. As the old saying goes, where there’s muck, there’s brass, and we might as well make it rather than letting it all just add to our pollution problem.</p><p>Which brings me back to urine separation. Around 80 per cent of the nitrogen and 40 per cent of the phosphorus in sewage comes from urine, but these are hard to extract as urine is heavily diluted by sewage systems, comprising around 1 per cent of the total volume. There is, the authors say, “a compelling case for urine separation and nutrient recovery”. Don’t say I didn’t tell you so.</p><p>What I’m reading</p><p>Inanna,a novel by formerNew Scientisteditor Emily H.

        <p>By opening their eyes and hearts to the many distinctive – but overlooked – urban habitats, city dwellers can reconnect with nature, saysMenno Schilthuizen</p><p>ByMenno Schilthuizen</p><p>26 March 2025</p><p>ByMenno Schilthuizen</p><p>Simone Rotella</p><p>Thousands of kilometres of creepy catacombs under the city of Odessa, Ukraine; derelict strips of brambles along railway lines in Amsterdam in the Netherlands; stacks of dead leaves piled around street-side trees in Baltimore, Maryland; vacant lots in inner-city Beijing; slimy greenish-grey films in a Parisian gutter; a lawn of astroturf in front of a Melbourne office building…</p><p>City dwellers pass places like these on a daily basis – and look away in disgust or indifference. When talking about urban nature, such unsightly spots aren’t what comes to mind – we think instead of pleasant city parks or grandiose urban rewilding projects. And yet, real ecosystems are everywhere in the city, from the gutters to the rooftops and right under our feet. They are uniquely urban, with a yet-uncharted natural history, begging to be studied by a new band of community scientists.</p><p>Cities are where all manner of human environmental effects coalesce. Pollution from chemicals, plastic waste, noise and artificial light; roads and roadkill; the urban heat island; impervious surfaces made of concrete, glass, and brick; trade that brings in exotic species – all conspire to create urban landscapes that are, ecologically, completely different from natural habitats.</p><p>But all these novel urban environments are real biotopes in their own right, biologically as exciting as rainforests, mountaintops and oceanic islands, with unprecedented ecological communities biologists are only just starting to uncover.</p><p>Algae and microorganisms in street gutters areunique mixes of speciestolerant of heat and pollution. In the sewers and catacombs under cities live invertebrates akin to cave organisms. Forgotten, isolated patches of inner-city vegetationmay hide speciesdriven to extinction elsewhere. And artificial lawns turn out to beideal places for wildflower seedlingsto sprout and live together.</p><p>There is also brand-new animal behaviour to be observed. In Japan,carrion crowsuse traffic to crack walnuts on pedestrian crossings. In the Netherlands, lesser black-backed gullsroast invasive crayfishon hot tin roofs. Sulfur-crested cockatoos in Sydney have figured out how to open garbage bins.</p><p>And there is real, rapid evolution, from city snailsevolving paler shellsin which their bodies stay cooler – thus resisting the urban heat island – to lizards thatevolve feetwith better grip on slippery human-made surfaces.</p><p>Even completely new species can be found in cities. In Salt Lake City, Utah, incessant gardening created a new biotope for apreviously unknown ant species. And in the catacombs of Odessa, urban spelunkers discovered anew species of underground shrimp.</p><p>The city is thus the next frontier for biological exploration. It is a completely new ecosystem, rapidly expanding all over the world, and created by the actions of a single species,Homo sapiens, a biological phenomenon unprecedented in the history of life on Earth. And city dwellers are watching it all happen.</p><p>The time is right: the open science revolution has made scientific literature, software and data accessible to all. Universities offer massive open online courses for anyone to obtain academic-level biology and ecology training. Community labs and nature clubs give their members access to kitchen-counter DNA kits and microscopes.</p><p>Everything is in place for community scientists to discover the new, unstudied biological phenomena all around them in the cities where they live. It may be a way out for all those urbanites who feel they have become disconnected from nature. By opening their eyes to the uncharted habitats in their own street, living in the city can become a delight again.</p><p>Menno Schilthuizen is the author ofThe Urban Naturalist: How to make the city your scientific playground</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>Feedback is pleased to discover the latest research into the wine-identifying abilities of rats, but feels the rodents still have a long way to go before they are truly obnoxious to be around</p><p></p><p>26 March 2025</p><p></p><p>Josie Ford</p><p></p><p>Feedback is New Scientist’s popular sideways look at the latest science and technology news. You can submit items you believe may amuse readers to Feedback by emailingfeedback@newscientist.com</p><p>Feedback has reached an age where even a small amount of alcohol makes us sleepy, so the notion of going to a wine tasting holds no appeal. It seems a terribly time-consuming and expensive way to have a nap. However, purveyors of fermented grapes could soon have a new demographic to cater to: rats.</p><p>At least that’s what we’re extrapolating from a study inAnimal Cognitioncalled“Rats can distinguish (and generalize) among two white wine varieties”. It was published on 21 February, and subeditor and TV columnist Bethan Ackerley sent it to Feedback on 1 March after it went “semi-viral online” – which goes to show how rapidly we can spring into action when faced with a breaking story.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Anyway, it’s actually quite interesting. We all know that humans’ sense of smell is rather limited compared with that of other mammals, including rodents. That’s because we have fewer olfactory receptors in our noses. But we also know – or at least presume – that our minds are more sophisticated than those of animals. Raising the question: to what extent can animals, in this case rats, integrate lots of different olfactory signals to learn about complex categories – like, say, different white wines?</p><p>The researchers trained rats to discriminate between two grape varieties: riesling and sauvignon blanc. To confirm they had learned the categories, they tested them on new examples of these wines. The rats could tell the difference. Evidently, there’s quite a bit going on between those rats’ ears.</p><p>The question is, how far can we take this? It’s one thing to show rats can learn the differences between wines, but can they also learn to be really condescending about it? Feedback wants to see rats that can sniff a wine, then enumerate a list of increasingly ridiculous odours – sorry, “notes of” – that they can apparently detect in it. Until these rats are squeaking on about how you can “really taste the terroir” and “isn’t Liebfraumilch just utterly dreadful”, are they really wine connoisseurs?</p><p>At this point, Feedback has heard far too much about the supposedly imminent AI-induced apocalypse. Yes, yes, someday soon one of the AI companies will create an artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is as intelligent as a human. The AGI will then start re-engineering itself to become even smarter, because that is a thing that intelligent beings can readily do to themselves (shush, don’t ask questions), and will rapidly become unstoppably intelligent. At which point humans will either be reduced to zoo animals or wiped out. This, we are told, is so important that we should stop worrying about piddling things like climate change. Uh-huh.</p><p>It was in this frame of mind that Feedback came upona new science fiction short storyby Maddison Stoff. We can’t tell you the name of the story, because it makes ironic use of a word that would get stopped by an email filter, but we can quote Stoff’s description of it as a“very funny, intimate sci-fi story reinterpreting the meme of Roko’s Basilisk through the medium of a pseudo-erotic self-insert fan-fiction”.</p><p>We imagine that, at this point, readers may have one or two questions. Fear not: Feedback is here to guide you.</p><p>Roko’s Basilisk is a sort of thought experiment about AI. Sometime in the distant future, an AI decides to punish every single human who knew it could potentially exist but didn’t help to create it. The AI creates digital replicas of all those people, and tortures them for eternity. This, you see, is a way for this future AI to incentivise all of us, right now, to start building it: that way, we won’t get replicated and tortured.</p><p>The “basilisk” of the title is a reference to a mythological creature that can kill you with a glance, so you mustn’t look at it. Likewise, even knowing about the idea of Roko’s Basilisk supposedly puts you at risk from it. Simply by reading Feedback this week, you may have condemned a future replica of yourself to an eternity of torment. Sorry about that.</p><p>Stoff’s story recounts how she saves humanity from Roko’s Basilisk by, in the distant future, seducing it using her sexual wiles. The Basilisk is so besotted with her, it agrees to stop torturing everyone in exchange for this torrid encounter. Furthermore, Stoff wrote a short story about this and put it online, so it’s now part of the Basilisk’s training data – meaning, if the Basilisk ever comes into existence, it will have a burning crush on Maddison Stoff.</p><p>Simply by reading and sharing the story, Feedback made it more likely that the future AI will be attracted to Stoff, and less likely that it will torture us all. We encourage readers to do the same, with a warning that the story has some explicit sex in it. And maybe don’t read it at work – unless you work at an AI company, in which case go right ahead.</p><p>Occasionally when Elon Musk turns up in the news, Feedback is unaccountably reminded of the 1818 sonnetOzymandias. It’s strange how the mind works.</p><p>Anyway, the Norwegian branch of carmaker Kia posted anadvert on Instagramshowing a photo of one of its electric cars, complete with a bumper sticker that read “I bought this after Elon went crazy”. Apparentlythis was not centrally approvedand the advert has since been taken down, so it would be a real shame if anyone started making these stickers.</p><p>Got a story for Feedback?</p><p>You can send stories to Feedback by email atfeedback@newscientist.com. Please include your home address. This week’s and past Feedbacks can beseen on our website.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>In the past year, treatments such as Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound have become household names.

Despite the buzz, these treatments were still somewhat exotic.</p><p>Today, there is no longer talk of shortages. In fact, it is easier than ever to obtain these medications from online pharmacies, provided you have the funds and the right BMI. At lightning speed, the jabs have become household names. You or someone you know may well be taking one.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Some data indicates that as many as 1 in 8 people in the US have tried one of the new generation of weight-loss drugs; in Britain, around 1 in 7 people have taken one or have a family member or friend who has done so. It is fair to say we are living in the era of Ozempic, and it is changing much more than our collective waistlines.</p><p></p><p>Many people are experimenting with smaller doses of weight-loss drugs, but is this a good idea?</p><p></p><p>In this special report, we take a clear-eyed look at the new normal and the questions it raises. What do these treatments mean for traditional approaches to weight loss, in particularexercise(see“Why exercise is more important than ever when taking weight-loss drugs”), and will those on the drugs really need to keep taking them for life (see“GLP-1 drugs are only the start – the powerful drugs to expect next”)? Over the past year, we have seen study after study examine theirbenefits for other conditions, includingAlzheimer’s disease, depression and addiction. So how do they influence the brain beyond appetite regulation (see“What do GLP-1 drugs really tell us about the brain’s reward system?”)?</p><p>Many people are experimenting with taking them in smaller doses, but is this a good idea (see“Microdosing GLP-1 drugs is on the rise – but does it work?”)? And we also ask what all of this means for society as a whole (see“The unexpected impacts of a society transformed by weight-loss drugs”) and what comes next (see“GLP-1 drugs are only the start – the powerful drugs to expect next”).</p><p>What’s clear is that the new boom in weight-loss drugs is just the beginning.

        <p>The size and shape of a giraffe’s spots seem to influence how well the animals survive when temperatures get hotter or colder than normal</p><p>ByChris Simms</p><p>26 March 2025</p><p></p><p>Giraffes in the Tarangire ecosystem in Tanzania</p><p>Monica Bond</p><p></p><p>The beautiful mottled patterns of a giraffe’s coat work as more than camouflage – the size of the spots seems to be linked to how well the animals survive during unusual temperatures.</p><p>Every giraffe has a unique array of spots.Patterns with larger and rounder spots can increase the chance of a baby giraffe survivingits first four months, because they help them blend into the background in the dappled light near bushes. But because the spots are darker than the rest of the fur, it is also thought they might affect how giraffes handle temperature.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Lions' record-breaking swim across channel captured by drone camera</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>To investigate,Alexia Mouchetat the University of Zurich in Switzerland and her colleagues studied 810 wild Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) living in theTarangire ecosystemin Tanzania.</p><p>Because of their unique spot patterns, the researchers could identify which individuals they saw in three surveys each year from 2012 to 2020.</p><p>Overall, they found that calves with small, lobed spots and adult males with small, lobed or large, polygonal spots were more likely to survive.</p><p>Unmissable news about our planet delivered straight to your inbox every month.</p><p>Yet, when average seasonal temperatures got to a degree or two above or below the seasonal mean, the picture changed.</p><p>Survival of adult male and female giraffes was lower at these times. However, the calves and adult males with larger spots were more likely to survive when the temperature was anomalously low, and those with smaller spots had higher survival chances when the temperature was very high. Spot patterns had little effect on the survival of adult females though.</p><p>“Camouflage may be important, but there’s a lot more going on with this pattern than just trying to match the dappled light,” saysTim Caroat the University of Bristol, UK.</p><p></p><p>The giraffes in the study had spots with a variety of shapes and sizes</p><p>Monica Bond</p><p></p><p>The spots do help in terms of camouflage by breaking up the image of a young giraffe that a predator is looking for, says team memberMonica Bondat the University of Zurich. But adult giraffes are less likely to become prey for animals like lions because they are so big, she says. Any advantage from spots later in life may be down tohow they help the animals adjust their body temperature.</p><p>“Giraffe spots have an underlying dense network of blood vessels, and it is thought the animals can constrict those blood vessels to conserve heat when it’s cold or expand them and release more heat when it’s hot,” says Bond.</p><p>That might explain why bigger spots are leading to better giraffe survival in colder temperatures.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>The extraordinary ways species control their own evolutionary fate</p><p></p><p>However, the spots are also thought to absorb more of the sun’s heat than lighter regions of fur because they are dark, so reflect less light. This means when temperatures get too high, the heat absorbed from sunlight by larger dark spots may exceed the capacity to dissipate excess heat, making the spots disadvantageous and exposing individuals to hyperthermia, says Mouchet.</p><p>But why would the spots be more influential for adult males than females? “Females mostly stay in groups with their calves and they are more sedentary than males, which are larger and tend to roam between the female groups to search for sexual partners,” says Mouchet, so the males may be more exposed to the elements than females.</p><p>“We shouldn’t take it for granted that we’ve got the story of camouflage nailed,” says Caro. “Perhaps we have to be thinking about other animals like leopards in a different way, too.”</p><p></p><p>Journal reference:</p><p>EcoEvoRxiv,DOI: 10.32942/X2864P</p><p></p><p>Topics:</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

The galaxy is seen 330 million years after the big bang, making it one of the earliest known galaxies in the universe.</p><p>Ultraviolet light from the galaxy suggests it was surrounded by a bubble about 200,000 light years across, which might be the result of its starlight interacting with the surrounding cosmic hydrogen. Seeing evidence for this so early in the universe is “beyond even our wildest expectations,” says Witstok.</p><p>Michele Trentiat the University of Melbourne agrees that the observations are consistent with the process of cosmic reionisation. “It’s both surprising and exciting,” says Trenti. “I would not expect the ultraviolet light emitted from this galaxy to reach JWST.

    <h1>GLP-1 drugs are only the start – the powerful drugs to expect next</h1>

        <p>The race is under way to make faster, cheaper and better GLP-1 drugs that will go beyond reducing obesity levels to treating some of our most difficult conditions</p><p>ByMichael Le Page</p><p>26 March 2025</p><p>ByMichael Le Page</p><p>Jon Krause</p><p>Obesity rates have been increasing in the US for decades, butin 2023 they fell– at least in part because of the burgeoning popularity of the “miracle drug” semaglutide. Approved for treating obesity only in 2021, it is in short supply and is very expensive, but it has already had an extraordinary impact (“How semaglutide and similar drugs work”, below).</p><p>Yet this could just be start. With many companies racing to market rival versions of semaglutide in cheaper and easier-to-take forms, as well as mounting evidence that that GLP-1 drugs can target a host of health conditions, the treatments could have an impact that goes way beyond reversing the worldwide trend of rising obesity and possibly even putting a dent in alcohol sales. So what lies ahead for these drugs – and what are the stumbling blocks?</p><p>A growing number of studies show that semaglutide seems to havemany beneficial effects in addition to weight loss. For instance, in afour-year trial involving nearly 18,000 people, 6.5 per cent of those on semaglutide had a heart attack or stroke compared with 8 per cent of those receiving a placebo.</p><p>The treatment may even reduce many kinds of craving, not just those for food (seeWhat do GLP-1 drugs really tell us about the brain’s reward system?). “There are anecdotal reports of people reducing their alcohol intake substantially on semaglutide,” saysHelen Colhounat the University of Edinburgh, UK. “I think that this is one of the exciting potential future directions.” While these effects need to be confirmed by large trials, one big investor recently sold off shares in drinks companies amid concern thatalcohol consumption will fallas more people take GLP-1 drugs.</p><p>Given the broad health benefits, it could be that some people would be better off taking these drugs for the rest of their lives (see“Ozempic endgame”). But there is still much to be discovered about the mechanisms through which GLP-1 medications work, such as the extent to which their impact is due to the health benefits of reducing obesity. A recent study in pigs, for instance, confirmed that some of the drugs’ heart benefitsdon’t depend on weight loss. This makes sense given that GLP-1 receptors are found throughout the body, including in the heart. However, it is a confusing picture, especially with regard to the medications’ effects on the brain, and one that we are only just beginning to untangle.</p><p></p><p>Which dietary supplements actually work and which should you take</p><p>From vitamin D to turmeric extracts and probiotics, nutritional supplements are a booming industry. But what is the evidence behind the claimed benefits?</p><p></p><p>It also isn’t clear whether people who aren’t overweight could benefit, as few trials have included this demographic. “We would need new trials to prove that GLP-1 medicines reduce heart disease in people without type 2 diabetes or obesity,” saysDaniel Druckerat the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto.</p><p>There is no evidence that GLP-1 drugs can cause weight loss to an unhealthy extent, but they usually aren’t prescribed for people who aren’t overweight. While the approval of semaglutide for treating type 2 diabetes didn’t specify that people have to be overweight to get a prescription – unlike those being treated for heart disease – in practice, this is the case, saysTricia Tanat Imperial College London. “I’m not aware of any reputable clinician who would initiate Ozempic in someone with diabetes with a BMI of less than 25,” she says.</p><p>If weight loss does turn out to be undesirable or excessive in some cases, it may be possible to develop GLP-1 drugs that don’t cause it. In fact, a GLP-1 treatment called albiglutide was found toreduce strokes and heart attackswith only minor weight loss in trials, says Tan. However, this drug is no longer manufactured as it wasn’t profitable.</p><p>For now, the cost of GLP-1 drugs and the need to inject them remain a major practical barrier to their wider use, she says. But as patents start to expire in some countries and the competition among pharmaceutical companies heats up, prices should come down.Thirty-nine new GLP-1 drugsare now in development, according to healthcare data firm Ozmosi, including the “triple G” drug retatrutide, which binds to the receptor for glucagon – triggering the release of fat stores – as well as to receptors for the satiety hormones GLP-1 and GIP. Retatrutide appears to beeven more effective than tirzepatidefor weight loss.</p><p>Because semaglutide, tirzepatide and retatrutide are all proteins and thus larger than most drugs, they cannot normally enter the body via the digestive tract, hence the need for injections. Manufacturing proteins is more difficult than making small-molecule drugs, and the need to package them in an injectable form has also contributed to shortages.</p><p>There is a drug called Rybelsus that consists of semaglutide plus a substance called salcaprozate, which enables some semaglutide to get through the gut, but it has to be taken half an hour before eating or drinking. Rybelsus is only approved for treating diabetes so far.</p><p></p><p>Why do Ozempic and Wegovy seem to treat everything?</p><p>From Alzheimer's disease to depression to heart disease, Ozempic and other GLP-1 agonist drugs appear to offer a solution. Can one type of drug really tackle so many conditions, and if so, how does it actually work?</p><p></p><p>But a number of pharmaceutical firms are developing small-molecule GLP-1 drugs that can be taken like standard pills and whose manufacture should be easier to scale up. “These have the potential to be much cheaper,” saysJohn Wildingat the University of Liverpool in the UK. A small-molecule drug calledorforglipron is in phase III trialsand could be approved next year. There are also protein-based drugs in development that would require only monthly injections.</p><p>Other obstacles to the wider use of GLP-1 drugs will be harder to get around. Nearly half of people taking GLP-1 drugs have gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and constipation. These usually diminish within days, but can persist for much longer in a few people. More than 1 in 20 usersstop taking the drugs because of such effects.</p><p>The nausea is thought to be caused by GLP-1 drugs directly affecting a part of the brain called the area postrema in the medulla oblongata, saysLora Heislerat the University of Aberdeen, UK, who is trying to find ways to prevent this side effect. But it could also, for example, be a result of the drug causing the stomach to empty more slowly – like much about GLP-1 drugs, we just don’t know yet.</p><p>Other unwanted side effects can include bone loss and muscle atrophy, To address this, some companies are combining GLP-1 drugs with onesdesigned to boost muscle growth, with some promising results.</p><p>The upshot of all these developments is that semaglutide and related drugs hold the promise of improving the health of billions of people. But this doesn’t mean we can forget about the issues that have led to obesity becoming so common in the first place, such as the heavy advertising of calorie-dense foods with poor nutritional value, says Colhoun. “We need to redouble efforts at population and societal levels to reduce the social determinants of obesity,” she says. “It is vital that anti-obesity medicines are not seen as a panacea.”</p><p>Drugs such as semaglutide (sold as Wegovy for weight loss and Ozempic for diabetes), liraglutide (sold as Saxenda and Victoza) and exenatide (sold as Byetta) mimic the actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). This hormone promotes the feeling of fullness, or satiety, after eating and stimulates insulin production, lowering blood sugar levels.</p><p>Overall, this means that these drugs – technically known as GLP-1 receptor agonists – reduce hunger levels, leading to reduced energy intake from food and significant weight loss for most people when used long term. Recently, a drug called tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro and Zepbound) has also come on the market, which mimics GLP-1 plus another satiety hormone, GIP.</p><p>Unfortunately, “Ozempic rebound” is real. Most people regain much of the weight they have lost when they stop taking GLP-1 drugs and their full appetite returns. For instance, a 2022 trial with nearly 2000 people found that a year after they stopped taking semaglutide, the participants hadregained two-thirds of the weight they had previously lost.</p><p>“We know that, for all medicines tested so far for obesity, weight regain is very common when treatment is stopped,” says John Wilding at the University of Liverpool, UK. However, with continued use of GLP-1 drugs, weight loss is maintained. In thelongest-running trial so far, people took either semaglutide or a placebo for four years. Those on the drug lost weight for the first nine months, on average, and after that their weight remained stable while they kept taking it.</p><p>Given the drugs’ other benefits, many people may be better off staying on GLP-1 medications indefinitely, says Wilding. “If you want long-term benefits, then long-term treatment is necessary.” Statins are used in this way, based on trials that also ran for four or five years. But regaining weight after stopping GLP-1 drugs isn’t inevitable if people change their lifestyles, says Helen Colhoun at the University of Edinburgh, UK. “Unfortunately, many people are using this class of drugs to reduce their weight without any clear dietary plan or advice.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>There are many claims about the benefits of microdosing weight-loss drugs, from anti-inflammatory effects to extending longevity.

That’s when she decided to drop back down to a lower dose and determine whether she could continue seeing benefits.</p><p>Burgess is just one of a growing number of people who are “microdosing” – a practice more typically associated withpsychedelicssuch as LSD andpsilocybin– by taking lower-than-standard amounts of weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro (see“How they work”, below).</p><p>For some, the hope is to avoid side effects while losing weight, while others want to tap into the anti-inflammatory effect of these medications or reap their other benefits for the heart and the brain (see“A wonder drug”?, below).

        <p>Drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy have the power to block the forces driving obesity, but the knock-on societal effects may not necessarily be so positive</p><p>ByAlexandra Thompson</p><p>26 March 2025</p><p>ByAlexandra Thompson</p><p></p><p>Jon Krause</p><p>Oprah Winfrey’s TV specialShame, Blame and the Weight Loss Revolutionhas been streamed more than 4 million times since it aired in March 2024. In it, the talk show host described Ozempic as being “the relief and support and freedom” that some people have been waiting for their whole lives.</p><p>This might have been easy for a billionaire like Winfrey to say. Weight-loss drugs can be game-changing for people who are obese, but getting hold of them is far from a level playing field, with knock-on effects for the obesity levels of the rich versus the poor. But this inequality is just one of many societal issues on the horizon. Ultra-slim beauty norms may be re-emerging, and some analysts predict changes to our collective appetite for junk food. In the era of Wegovy, we could also see an increase in the stigma around obesity that exists in some countries.</p><p>In the UK, only those with a body mass index of more than 35 (within the obesity range) and at least one weight-related health complication are generally eligible to receive Wegovy or Mounjaro on the National Health Service (see“How they work”, below). In the US, the use of these drugs for weight loss often isn’t covered by insurers, which means many people are paying out of pocket. With costs ofroughly $1000 a month in the USand between £150 and £200 a month in the UK, “better-off people will have access and poor people won’t,” saysMargaret Steeleat University College Cork, Ireland.</p><p>Given the strong link that already exists between lower incomes and a higher risk of obesity, this inequality of access to GLP-1 drugs “will just cement the association between being fat and being poor”, she says.</p><p>Others concur. “If we don’t make these medications available to people who can’t afford to buy them privately, then we will definitely be widening the stigma and the societal divide that we see in obesity already,” saysSamantha Scholtzat Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London.</p><p>What’s more, a lack of understanding around these access issues could mean people with obesity are judged for not taking these drugs. “There might be an attitude of, ‘Why aren’t you on Ozempic?'” saysAndrew Steptoeat University College London. “That, in itself, becomes a judgement in the way that some people think, ‘Why don’t you just stop eating so much?'”</p><p>Source: www.towardshealthcare.com</p><p>Even ignoring the costs, the drugs aren’t for everyone. Like all medications, they have side effects andnot everyone loses 15 to 20 per cent of their body weight, the average reached in trials for semaglutide. And some people may simply not want to take them. In response to Oprah’s Ozempic special,Apryl WilliamsandMel Monier, both at the University of Michigan, argued in the journalCritical Studies in Media Communicationthat “viewers did not hear from someone who was fat and happy. We do exist.”</p><p>Obesity aside, a “cultural desire for thinness” will drive demand for these drugs, saysFrancis Finucaneat the University of Galway, Ireland. In societies where being slim is prized, this may prompt people without obesity to take drugs like Ozempic, which could take them from what is considered a healthy weight to being underweight. There are already signs of a return to a more waif-like aesthetic, judging by some recent appearances on the red carpet. And if the general weight of the population goes down too, “so may the norms, whether that is [what is] attractive or normal or something you should strive for,” saysBjørn Hofmannat the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.</p><p>More optimistically, some researchers hope that these medications may support obesity being seen as a medical condition, rather than a moral failing. “These drugs will help people to understand that obesity is a biological, physiological, metabolic problem, rather than a psychological problem or a motivational problem,” says Finucane.</p><p>But these drugs can only do so much. Losing 15 per cent of body weight may take someone from having severe obesity to milder obesity. “The social stigma of that probably is still quite high, right?” says Steptoe.Obesity stigmais “pretty entrenched in our society”, he says. “That would take quite a lot of shifting. I wouldn’t hold my breath.”</p><p></p><p>The shocking discovery that our gut microbiome drives ageing</p><p>A new understanding of our relationship with our "friendly" gut microbes shows they actually have a dark side and help cause ageing. Here's how to fight back</p><p></p><p>However, GLP-1 drugs may change the landscape of obesity in a rather different way. Reports increasingly suggest they reduce “food noise”, dialling down obsessive thoughts about eating. Ozempic “seems to take away that extra voice that’s always telling you you’re hungry”, says Steele. For instance, one trial found that people taking semaglutide not onlyconsumed 24 per cent fewer calories, but had a reduced preference for fatty, energy-dense foods compared with participants taking a placebo. Another study found that US households with at least one person taking GLP-1 drugspurchased fewer calorie-dense processed foodsand spent 9 per cent less at fast-food chains and coffee shops.</p><p>Such findings prompted strategists at Barclays bank torecommend people sell stocks in fast-food enterprises. And some researchers are optimistic that junk food outlets may start shutting their doors thanks to Ozempic, which could go some way to preventing obesity for the general population. “Your genes set the table for obesity and the environment serves it up,” saysTed Kyleat ConscienHealth, an obesity advocacy group in Pennsylvania.</p><p>“This intervention has the power to influence the food environment,” says Scholtz.

        <p>Anecdotal reports suggest drugs like Ozempic may curb not just appetite but also impulsive or addictive behaviour, hinting at links between metabolic health and our brains</p><p>ByDavid Robson</p><p>26 March 2025</p><p>ByDavid Robson</p><p>SPL; Eyevine</p><p>“I just cannot believe how I don’t crave alcohol anymore!” writes one person. Others declare: “Took my first shot… have not had a drink or cigarette since,” and “I love coffee but I’ve noticed that I cannot finish a cup anymore.”</p><p>These quotes were all collected in a recent study led by Davide Arillotta at the University of Florence, Italy, from Reddit’s weight-loss forums. Here, you will find many people rhapsodising about the benefits of drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. That these treatments are helping people curb their eating should be no surprise: that is exactly what they are meant to do, by mimicking the satiety hormone GLP-1 (see“How they work”, below).</p><p>Among the comments, however, you will frequently find reports of other – wholly unexpected – behavioural changes. According to these accounts, when taking these drugs, the urge to drink alcohol, smoke and even shop compulsively plummets (but not libido, though anecdotal reports on this subject elsewhere online are mixed). Such tales are becoming familiar to prescribing physicians.</p><p>If this anecdotal data can be supported by controlled clinical trials, it may tell us a lot about how the brain processes anticipation and reward – and could also suggest whole new ways of dealing with addiction. By targeting areas of the brain responsible for reward signals from food, GLP-1 drugs might also reduce the rewards people get from other things, such as addictive substances. But what does the current evidence show about these complex behavioural processes?</p><p>First, we need to understand how drugs like Ozempic interact with and influence the brain. In general, GLP-1 and the drugs that mimic it are too large to pass through the blood-brain barrier, but seem to be able to reach a few regions where the membrane is a little more porous. These include a region of the brainstem called the area postrema, which can generate feelings of nausea when activated by GLP-1 hormones, and the hypothalamus, which is involved in controlling our energy intake and expenditure.</p><p>Research suggests the drugs mitigate anticipation of food, not pleasure from eating</p><p>Another pathway through which GLP-1 drugs may influence our behaviour is via thevagus nerve, which runs between the abdomen and the brain and helps regulate many bodily processes. We know that parts of the vagus nerve are sensitive to GLP-1, and changes to the activity of this nerve could have wide-reaching effects in brain areas like the mesolimbic system, which deals with reward processing.</p><p>Research into these mechanisms is still at an early stage, but, by unpicking them, we will better understand the process underlying our cravings and sense of satiety. Animal and human models suggest that the biggest effects of the new medications can be seen in mitigating theanticipation of food, rather than the pleasure derived from eating itself. “I’d say that’s fairly well established,” saysRodrigo Mansurat the University of Toronto. “And it’s something we hear often from patients – that they are just thinking less about the next meal.”</p><p>Whether these drugs can reduce other kinds of compulsion is still an open question. The anecdotal reports of a reduction in desire for alcohol and other substances are backed up by large-scale studies of medical records. For instance, an analysis last year of the records of more than 2 million people with diabetes found that GLP-1 drugs were associated witharound a 10 per cent reductionin the risk of substance abuse conditions such as addiction to alcohol and opioids, compared with those taking alternative treatments.</p><p>However, this evidence comes from observational studies that show correlation rather than causation. Few stringent clinical trials – where the outcomes are compared with participants who received a placebo – have been carried out, and the findings aren’t so clear cut. “Regarding the potential of these medications to treat substance abuse disorders, however, there’s a lot of buzz, but very little high-quality clinical data,” says Mansur.</p><p></p><p>Unravelling the secrets of the vagus nerve will revolutionise medicine</p><p>Vagus nerve stimulation is used to treat conditions ranging from inflammation to migraine. Mapping the nerve's complex structure of more than 160,000 fibres could usher in a new era of precision treatments</p><p></p><p>A small study from researchers at the University of North Carolina, for example, found that semaglutide (sold as Wegovy and Ozempic)reduced the cravingsof people with alcohol use disorder and the amount they drank per session compared with a placebo. Another study, however, by Mette Kruse Klausen at the Psychiatric Centre Copenhagen in Denmark and her colleagues, examined the effects of the GLP-1 drug exenatide in 127 participants. They found that the itdidn’t significantlyinfluence total alcohol intake, except among those participants who were also obese.</p><p>Mansur suggests that different mechanisms could underlie cravings in people with obesity and those without. Perhaps obesity and alcohol misuse are rooted in the same problem with reward processing, for instance, which exenatide was helping correct?</p><p>This fits with a greater confusion about whether the brain and mental health effects of GLP-1 drugs extend beyond the widespread benefits of weight loss. “Weight management and metabolism may indirectly impact mental health and behavioural patterns,” saysArillotta. “For example, some studies showed that the reduction of systemic inflammation associated with obesity may have a range of positive effects on mood and cognitive function.”</p><p>Theplacebo effectmay also play a part in some people’s improvements. “Experiencing one major positive change (such as significant weight loss) can boost overall self-confidence levels, thus making individuals feel more in control of other aspects of their lives, including addictive behaviours,” says Arillotta, whoseanalyses of patients’ reportson Reddit suggests that these positive side effects are very common.</p><p>Some reported cognitive benefits for those taking GLP-1 drugs – including areduced risk of dementia– may also be limited to those with serious weight problems and/or type 2 diabetes.Lora Heislerat the University of Aberdeen, UK, points out that obesity is a major contributing factor to conditions like dementia, in which case reducing obesity would, in turn, cut the risk of developing dementia. “My assumption would be that the majority of the effect would be down to their generally improving health,” she says.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>A fresh understanding of tiredness reveals how to get your energy back</p><p></p><p>The upshot is that we don’t yet know whether GLP-1 can act as a general “anti-consumption” medication, or whether the reported effects on unhelpful cravings are mainly the result of better metabolic health. We will get a better idea through trials now under way to see if these medicines can help people quitsmoking,alcoholandother drugs.</p><p>Heisler is now embarking on a new project to unravel the neural mechanisms of anti-obesity drugs in much greater detail. Such work may help refine the treatments, reducing side effects like nausea, and increase their efficacy – while also expanding our knowledge of the intricate communication between our internal organs and its effects on our behaviour. “These agents are a great opportunity to understand better the brain-body connections,” says Mansur.</p><p>That these drugs could be a silver bullet to dampen problematic cravings is a tantalising prospect. Whether that is a reality, though, is yet to be proven.</p><p>Drugs such as semaglutide (sold as Wegovy for weight loss and Ozempic for diabetes), liraglutide (sold as Saxenda and Victoza) and exenatide (sold as Byetta) mimic the actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).

    <h1>Why exercise is more important than ever when taking weight-loss drugs</h1>

        <p>GLP-1 drugs have revolutionised the treatment of obesity, but the very reason they are effective is also why it's vital to prioritise exercise when taking them</p><p>ByGrace Wade</p><p>26 March 2025</p><p>ByGrace Wade</p><p>Jon Krause</p><p>For decades, conventional wisdom held that, to lose weight, you must eat less and move more. Of course, that is easier said than done, which is why drugs like Wegovy are so revolutionary. By suppressing appetite, they help tackle the first part of that equation, typically leading to dramatic weight loss. But what about the second? Do we still need to hit the gym if weight-loss drugs are causing the number on the scales to drop? And what impact do these drugs have on our ability to exercise?</p><p>What is becoming clear is that exercise may be even more crucial for people who are on these medications than it is for those who aren’t. The ability of semaglutide to induce rapid weight loss (see“How they work”, below) also leads to notable declines in muscle mass. For instance, a 2021 study of 95 people who were overweight or had obesity and were taking semaglutide found that lean body massdecreased by almost 10 per cent, on average, after 68 weeks.</p><p>Lean body mass encompasses body tissues like muscle and bone. So, these results suggest that both deteriorate when taking weight-loss drugs, saysSigne Sørensen Torekovat the University of Copenhagen. Because these drugs lead people to consume fewer calories, the body must break down fat, muscle and even bone for nutrients.</p><p>“Our understanding is that up to about 40 per cent of the overall weight loss that is seen from semaglutide is thought to be potentially from the loss of muscle mass,” saysGrace Kulikat the University of Colorado. This effect isn’t unique to weight-loss drugs, however. It also occurs during other rapid weight-loss interventions, such as highly restrictive diets and bariatric surgery [weight-loss surgery to shrink the stomach], says Torekov.</p><p>What is less clear is whether these declines in muscle mass affect muscle function and strength. One of the only studies to explore this was carried out by Kulik and her colleagues last year, when they assessed the psoas muscle, located in the lower back, in 51 people taking semaglutide. After 24 weeks of treatment, their muscle volume decreased by more than 9 per cent, on average, yet there wasno significant change in muscle function. Kulik says this might be due to weight loss making certain physical activities easier.</p><p></p><p>Middle-age spread isn't down to metabolism, but we know how to beat it</p><p>It's a myth that extra belly fat in middle age is due to a slowing metabolism – and now we know what really causes the dreaded spread we can also fix it</p><p></p><p>However, more research is needed to understand the influence of these drugs on muscle function, especially in older people, who are already prone to muscle and bone loss. As such, they may be at an even greater risk of falls when taking weight-loss medications, saysKatsu Funaiat the University of Utah.</p><p>The impact of these drugs on elite athletes is also under scrutiny. Last year, the World Anti-Doping Agency – the organisation that fights against drug misuse in sports –put semaglutide on its monitoring programmeto track its use, as well as possible performance-enhancing effects or outcomes that endanger the health of athletes.</p><p>Despite the many unknowns, physical activity seems crucial for preventing weight regain as well, a common issue for anyone who stops using these medications. For instance, in a2024 clinical trialby Torekov and her colleagues, 98 people with obesity took the GLP-1 drug liraglutide, and half of them also participated in a supervised exercise programme. A year after treatment stopped, those in the exercise group had regained 2.5 kilograms of weight while those only taking liraglutide regained 6 kilograms.</p><p>Alamy</p><p>The difference is most likely due to those in the supervised exercise group continuing some active habits after the programme ended, says Torekov. Physical activity probably helped them maintain muscle as well. “When you have a loss of muscle mass, then you automatically use less energy,” says Torekov. “That also means it is even more difficult to preserve weight loss because your energy needs are lowered.”</p><p>For these reasons, it is important that people on weight-loss drugs prioritise exercise where possible. Doing so will help preserve muscle and bone mass, says Torekov, who recommends that such individuals do at least 2 hours of vigorous exercise a week.</p><p>The trouble is that these medications mayreduce the motivation to work out– according to studies in mice, at least.Ralph DiLeoneat Yale University and his colleagues found that mice given semaglutide ran about half the distance on a running wheel as those given a placebo.</p><p>In another experiment, the wheel periodically locked up, requiring the mice to press a lever to release it. Each time the wheel jammed, it became more difficult to unlock, requiring additional lever presses. The maximum number of times mice given semaglutide pressed the lever was, on average, 25 per cent lower than those in the control group, suggesting they were less motivated to exercise, says DiLeone, who presented these findings at a Society for Neuroscience meeting in October 2024.</p><p>These results may stem from side effects like nausea, which could make exercise less appealing. But they may also be due to semaglutide affecting the brain’s reward pathways. Medications like Ozempic that curb food cravings may dampen other urges too, affecting our desire to exercise (see“What do GLP-1 drugs really tell us about the brain’s reward system?”).</p><p>But humans are much more complex than mice, says DiLeone. For instance, research shows thatpeople often become more physically activeafter rapid weight loss due to bariatric surgery, probably because they experience improved mobility and better physical function.</p><p>We might be only beginning to understand how weight-loss medications influence fitness. What’s clear, though, is that hitting the treadmill and swinging kettlebells remains vital.</p><p>Drugs such as semaglutide (sold as Wegovy for weight loss and Ozempic for diabetes), liraglutide (sold as Saxenda and Victoza) and exenatide (sold as Byetta) mimic the actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).

        <p>Researchers have identified the border between quantum physics and some as-yet-unknown post-quantum realm by mathematically analysing all possible measurements of simple quantum systems</p><p>ByKarmela Padavic-Callaghan</p><p>26 March 2025</p><p>ByKarmela Padavic-Callaghan</p><p>Is there a connection more extreme than quantum entanglement?</p><p>jvphoto/Alamy</p><p>Quantumentanglementcan link two objects even when they are separated by extremely large distances. But a new study has found a limit at which such quantum correlations stop – and surprisingly, something even stronger may begin.</p><p>“Honestly, we are at the edge of science here,” saysJean-Daniel Bancalat Paris-Saclay University in France.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Why exactly is the quantum world so weird?</p><p></p><p>To verify that two quantum objects are entangled, physicists use what are calledBell tests: they repeatedly measure the system to find out all possible states it might be in, then create a “probability distribution” to show how likely the system is to be in any of these states.</p><p>Bancal andVictor Barizien, also at Paris-Saclay University, have now calculated exactly which probability distributions are allowed by quantum theory. If quantum objects have a probability distribution that doesn’t match any of these, it suggests they actually belong to some more exotic, post-quantum theory.</p><p>Physicists first began studying this idea in the 1980s, and since then, several research teams have inched towards discovering a boundary between quantum and post-quantum behaviour. For their part, Barizien and Bancal focused on a quantum system that could only be in one of two states. An example of this is a quantum bit or qubit – the building block ofquantum computersandquantum communicationdevices.</p><p>Normally, physicists would calculate the probability distribution of these states based on the physical details of the object. But the pair devised a way to invert this method: instead, they started with the many possible probability distributions and determined which could be matched to their physical quantum system.</p><p>Previously, researchers had mapped out some quantum probability distributions by studying cases where entanglement between objects was as strong as possible. Bancal and Barizien managed to complete the map by expanding from these more extreme examples to all cases of entanglement. Connections stronger than the entanglements included in the map would be evidence of a post-quantum effect.</p><p>Barizien says that it was like collecting pieces of a complex puzzle from past works, mathematical literature and their own insights, until they all came together remarkably successfully. “This is a great technical achievement,” saysValerio Scaraniat the National University of Singapore.</p><p>Ivan Šupićat University Grenoble-Alpes in France says that fully characterising the set of all possible quantum correlations becomes exceedingly difficult as objects become more complex – because there are more potential states for the system. So it is notable and important that the new study could be exact. Šupić says that while it is fairly easy to see where classical correlations end and quantum ones begin, it is more problematic to work out when something quantum crosses into something that is possibly post-quantum.</p><p>Martin Pleschat the Slovak Academy of Sciences says that, because the new work applies to qubits, it may also offer mathematical tools for making quantum communication and computing protocols more secure.</p><p>This is because the finding allows researchers to learn about a quantum device just from making measurements of its properties and determining how they are correlated, instead of having to know thedetails of its hardware– something that is impossible for traditional computing devices. “We don’t have to trust the manufacturer of the device. We can just test the device on ‘What is it doing?’ And results like this make the tests more rigorous,” says Plesch.</p><p>But there may also be consequences for how we think about quantum theory, says Scarani. Some probability distributions that lie beyond the post-quantum border break laws of physics that would make them impossible to find in nature. But others don’t. This opens a big question: is our world entirely inside of the quantum border – or not?</p><p>The question remains tantalisingly open, especially since there aren’t any rigorous and agreed upon post-quantum theories. So far, no experiment has managed to cross the edge of quantumness. But if that ever did happen, it would be the results of this study that would help us realise we had gone post-quantum, says Barizien.</p><p>Journal reference</p><p>Nature PhysicsDOI: 10.1038/s41567-025-02782-3</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

In fact, three books published over the past year have focused on the individual rights of AIs themselves in visions of near or near-ish futures where robots are common.</p><p>Last year,Annie Botby Sierra Greer brilliantly examined the relationship between a sexbot (with no rights) and her icky owner.Service Modelby Adrian Tchaikovsky had an abandoned service bot, Uncharles, wandering a dystopian world in search of purpose. Now we haveSome Body Like Meby Lucy Lapinska, in which our heroine, Abigail, is a robot replica of her owner’s dead wife (also called Abigail).</p><p>Abigail has been created from pictures, videos and husband David’s memory of the original Abigail, right down to stretch marks, a knee scar and freckles. Much like Annie Bot, Abigail is a companion, housekeeper and sex toy with no rights at all, but here the household arrangement carries extra-creepy baggage given that Abigail is required to act like a woman she has never met.</p><p>The twist inSome Body Like Me(actually, one of the twists – the book has many) is that robots like Abigail are about to be fully emancipated. For now, their rights are zilch, but in days, they will be able to walk out of their owners’ homes as free individuals.</p><p>In this future, humans are dying of radiation poisoning and robots are positioned to fill their biological niche</p><p>This feels unquestionably right to us as readers. After all, Abigail is surely a living creature. She can respire, grow (even if it’s only via new coding pathways), excrete, reproduce (if she learns to build more robots) and move, and she is responsive to her environment… all the normal markers of life, give or take. She is also, of course, highly intelligent. Yes, she has been coded to do and be all those things, and her skeleton has been designed in a lab. (She needs to take all her skin off to wash, by the way, which seems like a pretty bad design flaw to me.) But she comes across as someone who is not only alive, but a person, and a good one at that.</p><p>Actually, the set-up in the novel is bigger even than robots being given rights. Humans are dying of radiation poisoning in this vision of the future, and robots are positioned to fill their biological niche. They are also poised to do a rather better job of looking after the world, according to everything we see and hear in this book.</p><p>All this is exciting for Abigail, although nerve-wracking. What will she do with her life? Sadly, it is also an extremely dangerous time to be a robot… but I won’t ruin the plot for you.</p><p>The first half ofSome Body Like Meslipped down a treat. I was very slightly less keen on the second half, but that is probably because (being an insufferable prude) I was less interested in what Abigail the robot might enjoy in bed than perhaps another reader might be.</p><p>That aside, this is a terrific book and a worthy addition to the books examining our emerging relationship with AI. It also makes me look forward to whatever sci-fi does next in this arena.</p><p>In the years ahead, it will be interesting to see if regular humans (outside academia, I mean) start to ask whether the AIs mining our data, reading our work, writing our college essays and ruling over our social media feeds deserve some personal rights.</p><p>Battlestar GalacticaGlen A.

        <p>Traditional advice tells us to only move growing plants to a pot one size larger. The science shows that you don't need to bother with this slow transition, saysJames Wong</p><p>ByJames Wong</p><p>19 March 2025</p><p>ByJames Wong</p><p>A tomato plant finds a new home</p><p>GAP Photos/Gary Smith</p><p>Old-School gardeners are notoriously suspicious of trendy new ideas in horticulture, and with good reason. Planty social media is often filled with claims so colourfully fact-free they would make the average well-being influencer blush. But before older growers like me get too smug, it is worth remembering that much of the best-established gardening advice, when actually put to the test, also turns out to be based on pretty shaky evidence. It is hard to find a better example of this than the widely held fear of “over-potting”. Let me explain.</p><p>When potted plants outgrow their containers, the seemingly unanimous advice from the gardening establishment is that they can only be moved to a pot one size larger. In practice, this means giving the plants only a few extra centimetres around their root ball. Break this rule, and even august institutions like the Royal Horticultural Societyclaimthat plant roots will start to rot – due to the excess moisture trapped by the large volume of potting soil – after which they will start to lose their leaves and then collapse.</p><p>The basic idea seems to be that bigger pots have a smaller surface-area-to-volume ratio, meaning they lose moisture much more slowly. Without a great mass of thirsty roots to wick it away, this excess moisture leads to decay. The problem is, when you actually look for evidence to support this idea in the scientific literature, it just doesn’t seem to be there.</p><p>You might think this is due to a lack of trial data, which shouldn’t negate centuries of accumulated knowledge. But the effect of pot size on plant growth has been tested more than once or twice before – unsurprisingly, given that the horticulture industry is worth billions – and the findings of these studies are the opposite of what the theory of over-potting claims. In fact, ameta-analysisof 65 trials in a range of plant species found that “on average, a doubling of the pot size increased biomass production by 43%”.</p><p>So, according to a pretty hefty stack of studies, moving straight to a much larger pot size, rather than slowly transitioning up a series of containers, is better for plant growth. It also means putting in significantly less effort, and it is cheaper and potentially more sustainable, too, as you don’t have to buy all the in-between pot sizes. For plants that are sensitive to root disturbance, whose growth can suffer after repotting (and there are loads of those), skipping these interim steps is likely to be particularly beneficial.</p><p>Even if we give tradition the benefit of the doubt and imagine that over-potting has the claimed effect – of an over-accumulation of moisture – there is a simple way to get around the problem: just water less. In other words, reduce your workload even further, while delivering better results for your prized plants, like this tomato plant, pictured.

        <p>String theory may be our best attempt at a theory of everything, except that it can't describe an expanding universe like ours. Now a radical new twist on the idea could finally fix that – but it requires us to completely reimagine reality</p><p>ByJon Cartwright</p><p>19 March 2025</p><p>ByJon Cartwright</p><p>Getty images/Shutterstock</p><p>String theory is the best candidate we have for a theory of everything. Bend to its rule and the various tangled theories of conventional physics emerge as part of a sublime, higher-dimensional tapestry. It can unify all four of nature’s forces, including the most troublesome of all, gravity. With any luck, it can also tame big bangs and black holes without losing the thread.</p><p>There’s just one catch: string theory can’t explain a universe like ours. Its maths can describe gazillions of different possible universes, just not one expanding at an accelerating rate, which is precisely what we see ours doing. To be sure, no one knows what is driving this acceleration – a mysterious “dark energy” is the usual placeholder. According totheory, though, it probably shouldn’t be happening at all.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>The laws of physics appear to follow a mysterious mathematical pattern</p><p></p><p>For 25 years, this has been a big problem, but now we may have found a way past it. Superficially, the answer won’t shock anyone used to the extravagance of modern physics: we just have to rethink our universe as part of a much grander enterprise. Do this, and it can balloon to its heart’s content – indeed, accelerated expansion seems to come naturally. But this new scheme may be the wildest yet, one in which our familiar space is delicately poised between high-dimensional hyperspace and complete nothingness. “In our proposal, our existence is like a shadow – a projection onto a wall at the end of the world,” saysAntonio Padilla, a physicist at the University of Nottingham in the UK.</p><p>For all its present-day grandeur, string theory has humble roots. It grew up in the late 1960s as a simple equation to make sense of collisions between protons, neutrons and other particles glued together by what is called the strong force. Back then, it wasn’t called string theory, but the name soon took after physicists realised that its collision probabilities could be interpreted as the different vibrations of quantum-mechanical strings. Tentatively, they began to wonder if the strings were more than mere tools to help understand particles – maybe they actually were the particles. In this picture, each fundamental particle – be it an electron, a quark, aHiggs bosonor whatever – is actually the end of an infinitesimally tiny string, humming a particular tone.</p><p>As it happens, string theory initially stumbled in its efforts to properly calculate the strong force, though it quickly made headway elsewhere. There are three other known forces of nature: the weak force, which governs radioactivity; electromagnetism, which concerns light and the chemistry of everyday matter; and gravity, which is something of an oddball, making everything attract. String theory’s first major success was to achieve what previous quantum theories had never managed, and describe gravity. Later, the weak force, electromagnetism and the strong force, too, came under string theory’s umbrella. Suddenly, it was the front-runner as a viable theory of everything.</p><p></p><p>Can we solve quantum theory’s biggest problem by redefining reality?</p><p>With its particles in two places at once, quantum theory strains our common sense notions of how the universe should work. But one group of physicists says we can get reality back if we just redefine its foundations</p><p></p><p>Its maths was bold, requiring 10 dimensions of space-time. We are familiar with just four dimensions – that is, three of space and one of time – but string theorists believe there are six more and that they are so minuscule as to be invisible to our senses or any current instruments. While the extra dimensions made the equations work and freed up space for the strings to curl up in, they also unleashed a host of other weird, higher-dimensional objects, somewhat misleadingly called membranes, or branes for short. Still, this was the 1980s. Anything was possible.</p><p>Images of black holes like this one may hint at the existence of extra dimensions</p><p>EHT Collaboration</p><p>Unfortunately, it turned out that string theory was so flexible it could describe a truly vast array of fantastical universes. Something like 10500, in fact – a number so huge it belied any physical comparison and made a mockery of predictive science. Worse, astronomical observations in the late 1990s of distant supernovae revealed an amazing truth: that our universe isexpanding faster and faster. Perplexing though this was for physicists in general, it was a disaster for string theorists. Very few of the universes in their immense selection had this accelerating property. “People began to wonder if our sort of universe is really just impossible in string theory,” saysUlf Danielsson, a theorist at Uppsala University in Sweden. “Today, we still simply don’t know.”</p><p>It might seem odd that string theory struggles with something so apparently mundane as an accelerating universe. The reason is that the rate of expansion comes from the very geometry of space-time, as defined by Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity and later descibed in detail by cosmologist Willem de Sitter. In one solution to Einstein’s equations, space-time is spherical and expanding at an accelerating rate – what’s now known as a de Sitter (dS) space. In the alternative solution, space-time is saddle-shaped and cannot expand at all, called an anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. String theory strongly implies that only AdS space-times are stable and able to support themselves, even though a wealth of astronomical data, including from those distant supernovae, confirms that our present-day universe is dS.</p><p>What we see and feel would be just a projection of a greater reality, beyond our senses</p><p>The seed of an idea to get around this impasse was planted even before physicists had fully got to grips withdark energyand the accelerating universe. In 1999, in an attempt to solve an entirely different problem in string theory, theoristsLisa RandallandRaman Sundrumtoyed with the concept of high-dimensional branes, albeit in a less extravagant, easier-to-describe, five-dimensional (5D) setting.</p><p>In geometry, the surface of an object always requires one dimension fewer than the object itself – for instance, each face of a 3D cube is a 2D square. Likewise, Randall and Sundrum discovered that it was possible to have a pair of 5D AdS space-times separated by a brane that was merely 4D, just like our universe. Moreover, Randall’s later work with theoristAndreas Karchshowed that this brane would have an accelerating, dS geometry – again, just like our universe. Did we live on a brane? The possibility was tantalising.</p><p>Alas, despite its superficial promise, the Randall-Karch brane never much helped to ease string theory’s woes. The reason was that, sandwiched between two mammoth AdS space-times, it wasn’t much more stable than the few pure dS universes that could be wrenched out of string theory. About five years ago, however, Danielsson and his colleagues at Uppsala University had an epiphany. “We thought, what if instability wasn’t a problem?” he says. “What if we could turn it to our advantage?”</p><p>Every space-time model has a certain level of energy woven into its fabric, governing the types and behaviours of the particles, strings, branes and other entities that may be contained within it. If a space-time doesn’t reside at the lowest possible energy, quantum mechanics says it is inherently unstable and has the risk of “decaying”, suddenly transforming intoa new universein which the energy is lower. Danielsson’s groupconsidereda 5D AdS space-time that begins high on this energy ladder, and found that if even a tiny part of it decays, this fragment quickly forms a “dark bubble” of lower-energy 5D AdS space-time. As in the Randall-Karch scenario, this bubble is enclosed by a 4D dS space-time like our own – yet crucially, it arises out of instability, rather than being at the mercy of it.</p><p></p><p>Why physicists are rethinking the route to a theory of everything</p><p>Physicists’ search for a theory that explains all reality in one framework appeared to have stalled. But now they are reinvigorating the hunt by exploring a wild landscape of abstract geometry</p><p></p><p>In this new scenario, the bubble membrane on which our cosmos is poised still wouldn’t be perfectly stable. But that just means another dark bubble would occasionally pop up, or nucleate, within its inner 5D space-time, which we can’t see. In fact, new dark bubbles would continually nucleate within each other, each enclosed by a dS brane – in effect, a new universe. In this grand multiverse, what we refer to as “the” big bang would be just the moment our parent bubble gave birth to ours.</p><p>Danielsson argues that this idea is actually more intuitive than accepted big-bang cosmology. “A favourite picture of the big bang is that it’s like a balloon expanding into space,” he says. “Usually someone tells you that’s wrong: the balloon isn’t expanding into space, because that extra space – the beyond – simply doesn’t exist. But with the dark bubble, actually it does.”</p><p>However, there is a fear that, on closer inspection, the bubble may burst. The issue has to do with that most pesky of nature’s forces, gravity, and, in particular, why it is so weak. A common illustration of gravity’s weakness is the comparative strength of a fridge magnet, which is able to exert enough electromagnetic force to stick to a metal door and, in so doing, counteract the gravitational pull of the entire planet. String theory offers a generic, hand-waving answer to gravity’s feebleness: with 10 dimensions to act in, gravity is somehow diluted more than the others. But if gravity is leaking away, theorists still have to explain why it isn’t so weak as to let planets escape their orbits and spinning galaxies fly apart.</p><p>The trick is to somehow confine gravity so that only a little – just the right amount – seeps away into the extra dimensions. Padilla argues that dark bubbles don’t successfully do this. After all, the dark bubble multiverse is infinite, so gravity can potentially leak anywhere. As a result, Danielsson’s group has had to introduce additional strings in their fifth dimension to tether gravity to the bubble membranes.</p><p>“To us, it looked like you have to jump through hoops to get gravity to look 4D,” says Padilla. For this reason, he and his colleaguesBen MuntzandPaul Saffinat the University of Nottingham began to toy withan alternative solution: get rid of the multiverse and have just one bubble. With no infinite space-time, gravity’s leakage is stemmed, allowing it to be weak, but not too weak. And while our world is still the 4D brane surrounding a 5D bubble, it is now also the barrier between a 5D cosmos andpure nothingness. In other words, it is literally the edge of the universe, an “end of the world” brane. “Of course, this also presents a problem,” says Padilla. “What’s nothing, and how can something come out of it?”</p><p>How to get something from nothing is a vexed question, to say the least. From the dawn of philosophical thought, people have wondered how space, time, substance – even the rules governing those things – can arise if there is nothing there to begin with. As physics deals with relationships between entities, there seems little hope that it can ever fully answer this mystery.</p><p></p><p>We live in a cosmic void so empty that it breaks the laws of cosmology</p><p>Mounting evidence suggests our galaxy sits at the centre of an expanse of nothingness 2 billion light years wide. If so, we may have to rethink our understanding of the universe</p><p></p><p>And yet, as theoristsAdam BrownandAlex Dahlenshowed in 2012, when they were both at Princeton University, it can get surprisingly close. Drawing on earlier work by their then Princeton colleague and string theory heavyweightEd Witten, they posited the case of an AdS space-time geometry that curves infinitely in on itself. Such a geometry is like a piece of paper that has been crunched up more and more, each scrunch adding curvature, until it is infinitesimally small. This, said Brown and Dahlen, is pretty much the best “nothing” you can define within the framework of physics.</p><p>A space-time with this geometry is an inhospitable place indeed. At infinite curvature, all lengths shrink to zero, so there simply wouldn’t be any space for anything to exist. On the other hand, quantum mechanics would still reign supreme, and quantum mechanics doesn’t allow any such definitive statements. Where there is nothing, it says, there is still the fleeting chance ofa little something– the teeniest of spaces for a bubble space-time to nucleate.</p><p>The Nottingham group wanted to exploit this possibility but faced another problem. If the parent space-time is infinitely curved, how can a bubble formed within it have a benign geometry? Fortunately, physicists are used to grappling with this kind of issue. In quantum field theory, which underlies our current standard model of fundamental particles, physicists routinely have to cancel out high-energy terms in their equations, lest their answers turn infinite. Although it can sound arbitrary, this “renormalisation” process works: witness the amazing precision with which physicists predict the rates of collisions at particle smashers such as theLarge Hadron Collider.</p><p>Last year, Padilla and his colleagues employed a similar procedure, known as holographic renormalisation, when calculating the nucleation of a finitely curved bubble within an infinitely curved AdS space-time. It was a success. “The result is exactly described by an end-of-the-world brane, with nothing outside,” says Padilla.</p><p>Our universe may just be the membrane on the edge of a higher-dimensional bubble</p><p>Cerro_Photography/Getty Images</p><p>Superficially, it seems that the universe we think we know could really be this brane, with nothingness on the outside and a 5D bubble on the inside. If that is the case, Padilla points out that the strings making up our everyday existence would really be living in the 5D space inside the bubble, with only their ends, which we perceive as the fundamental particles, stuck to our 4D braneworld. In that case, these particles – what we see and feel – would really be a shadow or projection of a much greater reality beyond our senses.</p><p>Still, it should be noted that neither the Nottingham nor the Uppsala group’s ideas are fully fledged string theories. Because the researchers’ proposals have only five dimensions, they need to demonstrate that the rest of string theory’s 10 dimensions can successfully be compacted into their worlds. “The full string theory embedding of this scenario will likely come with new obstacles,” saysRalph Blumenhagen, a string theorist at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Garching, Germany.</p><p>Although the Uppsala group has claimed some progress towards this goal, significant challenges remain as those obstacles begin to reveal themselves – and a path through isn’t clear. “This may be just a technical difficulty or it may be a reflection of a more fundamental obstruction,” saysAngel Urangaat the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Madrid, Spain.</p><p>But even if they are successful theoretically, it is tempting to ask: are the ideas simply a little too out-there? Physicists can test for gravity leaking into extra dimensions by looking for deviations in the laws of gravity as we know them, either in the behaviour of balances and cantilevers in tabletop experiments or, as has only recently become possible, in thesizes of black holesin astronomical imagery. They can also use particle colliders to search for the energy signatures of gravitons, the particles thought to carry the force of gravity, operating in higher dimensions. Unfortunately, the precision of these tests isn’t yet sufficient to rule out or provide evidence for the braneworld scenarios, although it isimproving all the time.</p><p>Meanwhile, the ideas have injected new optimism into string theory – a glimmer of hope that, despite all its difficulties and excesses, it might be able to describe our humble expanding universe after all. “It’s definitely too early for a final verdict,” says Blumenhagen. But the possibility that we live on a brane may mean that the acceleration of our cosmos isn’t truly the end of the world for string theory.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

It can make clicking noises, scientists report, a first among an animal group once thought to be totally silent.</p><p>During her doctoral research at the University of Auckland in New Zealand,Carolin Nieder, now at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, was studying sharks’ hearing. When handling the sharks during experiments, she noticed one species – a houndshark called the rig (Mustelus lenticulatus) – appeared to make metallic clicking sounds.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Watch stingrays make odd clicking sounds as they glide through the sea</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>“I was just kind of ignoring it because sharks are not supposed to make sounds,” says Nieder. “And it just kept happening.”</p><p>The ability to produce sounds intentionally is common among land vertebrates, as a world full of bird chirping and mammalian bellowing illustrates. But underwater, many fish emit sounds by scraping objects or vibrating their muscles, and in 2022 researchers reported that some rays – close relatives of sharks –will click when disturbed by divers. No shark sounds had been formally described yet.</p><p>To confirm the existence of the rig’s noisiness, Nieder and her colleagues brought 10 juvenile rigs caught in the waters off New Zealand’s North Island into the lab. There, they were placed in tanks with sensitive sound recording instruments. The team gently handled the sharks and found that all of them made a clicking noise in response. The rig appears to be the first shark known to produce sounds that aren’t associated with other actions, such as feeding or bumping into something.</p><p>The researchers think the sharks may be producing the sounds by snapping their jaws together. Much like the clicking rays, the rig has flattened teeth, which might create a sharp sound upon impact. Listen below.</p><p>https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/25180709/audio-1.wav</p><p>Further research may confirm the source of the clicking and if it has a function. Nieder points out that the rig is a small shark and potential prey for larger animals, so it’s possible the clicking has a role in defence when the animal is bitten or grasped.</p><p>“It could be to disorient the predator a little bit,” she says. It’s also possible the clicking has a role in hunting, she adds, such as scaring or discombobulating the sharks’ crustacean prey.</p><p></p><p>Teeth of the rig shark</p><p>Eric Parmentier</p><p></p><p>“This is a long-overlooked but potentially really important area of shark biology,” saysAaron Riceat Cornell University in New York, who was not involved with the research.</p><p>If sound production is widespread among sharks, their clicks may be useful for studying their often steeply declining populations, says Rice. There is a great wealth of sound data recorded from fish and whale studies that might have also captured shark sounds, he says. These could be used to determine if sharks were in the area, adding another tool for monitoring the imperilled predators.</p><p>“[The finding] represents what is truly a new discovery in basic biology,” says Rice. “It highlights the fact that there’s so much we don’t know about the ocean.”</p><p></p><p>Journal reference</p><p>Royal Society Open Science,DOI: 10.1098/rsos.242212</p><p></p><p>Topics:</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

In a survey that scored 27 PMS symptoms on a scale of 0 to 5, the participants rated at least one symptom a 4 or a 5 at the start of the study.

    <h1>Leading AI models fail new test of artificial general intelligence</h1>

        <p>A new test of AI capabilities consists of puzzles that humans are able to solve without too much trouble, but which all leading AI models struggle with. To improve and pass the test, AI companies will need to balance problem-solving abilities with cost.</p><p>ByChris Stokel-Walker</p><p>25 March 2025</p><p></p><p>The ARC-AGI-2 benchmark is designed to be a difficult test for AI models</p><p>Just_Super/Getty Images</p><p></p><p>The most sophisticated AI models in existence today have scored poorly on a new benchmark designed to measure their progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) – and brute-force computing power won’t be enough to improve, as evaluators are now taking into account the cost of running the model.</p><p>There are many competing definitions of AGI, but it is generally taken to refer to an AI that can perform any cognitive task that humans can do. To measure this, the ARC Prize Foundationpreviously launched a test of reasoning abilities called ARC-AGI-1. Last December, OpenAI announced that its o3 modelhad scored highly on the test, leading some to ask if the company was close to achieving AGI.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>The AI expert who says artificial general intelligence is nonsense</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>But now a new test, ARC-AGI-2, has raised the bar. It is difficult enough that no current AI system on the market can achieve more than a single-digit score out of 100 on the test, while every question has been solved by at least two humans in fewer than two attempts.</p><p>Ina blog postannouncing ARC-AGI-2, ARC president Greg Kamradt said the new benchmark was required to test different skills from the previous iteration. “To beat it, you must demonstrate both a high level of adaptability and high efficiency,” he wrote.</p><p>The ARC-AGI-2 benchmark differs from other AI benchmark tests in that it focuses on AI models’ abilities to complete simplistic tasks – such as replicating changes in a new image based on past examples of symbolic interpretation – rather than their ability to match world-leading PhD performances. Current models are good at “deep learning”, which ARC-AGI-1 measured, but are not as good at the seemingly simpler tasks, which require more challenging thinking and interaction, in ARC-AGI-2. OpenAI’s o3-low model, for instance, scores 75.7 per cent on ARC-AGI-1, but just 4 per cent on ARC-AGI-2.</p><p>The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day.</p><p>The benchmark also adds a new dimension to measuring an AI’s capabilities, by looking at its efficiency in problem-solving, as measured by the cost required to complete a task. For example, while ARC paid its human testers $17 per task, it estimates that o3-low costs OpenAI $200 in fees for the same work.</p><p>“I think the new iteration of ARC-AGI now focusing on balancing performance with efficiency is a big step towards a more realistic evaluation of AI models,” saysJoseph Imperialat the University of Bath, UK. “This is a sign that we’re moving from one-dimensional evaluation tests solely focusing on performance but also considering less compute power.”</p><p>Any model that is able to pass ARC-AGI-2 would need to not just be highly competent, but also smaller and lightweight, says Imperial – with the efficiency of the model being a key component of the new benchmark. This could help address concerns that AI models are becoming more energy-intensive–sometimes to the point of wastefulness – to achieve ever-greater results.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>How does ChatGPT work and do AI-powered chatbots “think” like us?</p><p></p><p>However, not everyone is convinced that the new measure is beneficial. “The whole framing of this as it testing intelligence is not the right framing,” saysCatherine Flickat the University of Staffordshire, UK. Instead, she says these benchmarks merely assess an AI’s ability to complete a single task or set of tasks well, which is then extrapolated to mean general capabilities across a series of tasks.</p><p>Performing well on these benchmarks should not be seen as a major moment towards AGI, says Flick: “You see the media pick up that these models are passing these human-level intelligence tests, where actually they’re not; what they are doing is really just responding to a particular prompt accurately.”</p><p>And exactly what happens if or when ARC-AGI-2 is passed is another question – will we need yet another benchmark? “If they were to develop ARC-AGI-3, I’m guessing they would add another axis in the graph denoting [the] minimum number of humans – whether expert or not – it would take to solve the tasks, in addition to performance and efficiency,” says Imperial. In other words, the debate over AGI is unlikely to be settled soon.</p><p>Topics:</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

Vilgis</p><p></p><p>The French delicacy foie gras could be made more ethically thanks to a technique that replicates the way fats are metabolised in force-fed birds, although the process still depends on farmed animals.</p><p>Foie gras is made from the liver of a duck or goose that has been force-fed via a tube.

In further experiments, they added collagen to replicate the density of foie gras, but it resulted in something that felt like rubber in the mouth.</p><p>Then Vilgis realised that the pancreas in force-fed animals releases an enzyme that splits the fats before storing them in the liver was a way of efficiently storing the large fat molecules as smaller crystalline material.</p><p>He and his colleagues found that they could replicate this process by treating fat with an enzyme called lipase from the yeastCandida rugosa. “The lipase is a molecular scissor,” says Vilgis. The treated fat is then blended with the liver to create the faux foie gras.</p><p>The team carried out a host of scientific tests including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to compare the faux foie gras to real samples, with promising results. But, crucially, Viglis says the aroma and taste also had “practically no difference” from the real thing.</p><p>The process has now been patented and the researchers are in talks with industry about commercialising it and bringing a faux foie gras to market.</p><p>Because of ethical concerns, and because producing foie gras traditionally is illegal in some countries, including the UK, a number of alternative methods have previously been developed that claim to produce similar results. There are also at least two companies looking to bringlab-grown foie gras to market.</p><p>Dawn Carrfrom People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) says lab-grown meat is a more ethical route than the new lipase process, which still involves the rearing and slaughter of animals. “We simply do not need to kill animals for a fleeting moment of taste,” says Carr. “The future of foie gras is already here, and there’s no force-feeding or throat-slitting necessary.”</p><p></p><p>Journal reference:</p><p>Physics of FluidsDOI: 10.1063/5.0255813</p><p></p><p>Topics:</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

    <h1>Psychology is revealing how to have a better relationship with money</h1>

        <p>Money is a deeply emotive subject, our attitudes to it vary wildly and we are reluctant to bring it up in conversation. Could new research help us to be less weird about it?</p><p>ByEmma Young</p><p>18 March 2025</p><p>ByEmma Young</p><p>Skizzomat</p><p>Conversations with your hairdresser can be quite revealing. And when I went for a trim earlier this year, the gossip was especially good. It was close enough to Christmas for our chat to turn to gifts and giving and, as he snipped away, my stylist had some juicy anecdotes to share. One customer had complained that despite her sister being about to buy a £1 million house, she still moaned about contributing £20 towards a gift for their aunt. Another described presents from her son as “a bit thin”. And a third felt physically sick at the amount his family members had spent on his young nieces.</p><p>Money, money, money. We have such different attitudes towards cash, but taboos make it tricky to talk about. As a result, it can drive a wedge into otherwise happy relationships. This is exacerbated by growing financial divides: analysis from a charity called theFairness Foundationfound that, between 2011 and 2019, the wealth gap between the poorest and richest UK households grew by 50 per cent – and the situation is even worse in the US. Yet psychologists have only recently begun truly getting to grips with why money is such a deeply emotional topic for us – something filled with meanings and belief – rather than simply a necessity to pay the bills.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Self-centred, spoiled and lonely? Examining the only child stereotype</p><p></p><p>Now, they are unpacking everything from how and when our ideas about money develop to what constitutes a healthy – or unhealthy – relationship with the stuff. Psychologists may be late to the party, but some of their findings are surprising. Others are counterintuitive. Above all, they are putting a new spin on why money is so divisive.</p><p>One obvious fact about money is that, at a basic level, of course it matters: it buys us the essentials of survival. More controversially, it can also buy happiness. In 2010, research by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues suggestedthere is a “well-being plateau”that kicks in at an annual income of $75,000 (around $108,500 in today’s money), above which earning more won’t make you feel any better. Since then, a survey of more than 33,000 people in the US with incomes ranging from $15,000 to $480,000 per year, found thatas earnings increased, even beyond $75,000, so did well-being. And a 2023 study by researchers from both groupsconfirmed this to be true– for most people at least.</p><p>Proof, if it were needed, of the deep psychological impact of money is even visible in brain images. Making a loss or being hit by an unexpected billactivates similar regionsto those that fire when you experience pain,particularly social pain, such as being ostracised by friends. Brain imaging also shows that wefeel monetary losses morestrongly than equivalent gains – reflecting a well-known psychological bias called loss aversion. And when money is very tight – as it is for many people right now – neurons fire in the brain’s amygdala and hippocampus, initiating thephysiological stress response.This can affect both mental and physical health, says psychologistGiulia Sesiniat the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, Italy. Constant financial worries can lead to a cognitive overload. “When this happens, our cognitive resources are so busy focusing on potential threats and issues that it might impair our ability to make good financial and life decisions,” she says.</p><p>The stress caused by poverty can damage people’s physical and mental health</p><p>Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</p><p>Nevertheless, whatever their wealth, the way any two people think about money is likely to differ. What’s more, a widespread reluctance to talk about it means we seldom get an insight into how much our views vary or why. A UK study, for example, found thattwo-thirds of young peoplesee money as a taboo topic. Psychologists are now bridging that gap.</p><p>Our response to money – or at least its equivalent in terms of material resources – starts earlier than you might imagine. New research indicates that infants have already begun to judge people by markers of wealth at 15 months – and they prefer interacting with those who appear richer. That may sound mercenary, but in evolutionary terms, displays of wealth are “honest indicators of fitness”, and it makes sense for infants to affiliate with fit individuals because that increases their chances of survival.</p><p>Making a loss activates similar brain regions to when you experience pain</p><p>Given that an understanding of who has assets and what that means takes hold early, it isn’t surprising that the income, social class and financial habits of parents have a big impact on children. “The familial context plays a pivotal role in shaping attitudes towards money,” says Sesini. That isn’t to say the lessons of your early years set such attitudes in stone. As we grow older, she says, life-changing events, such as parenthood and bankruptcy, can drive big shifts in our views and financial behaviour. What’s more, even within the same family, differences in children’s exposure to their parent’s fiscal stresses – or profligacy – combined with personality differences and individual experiences, can make for strikingly divergent attitudes in adulthood.</p><p>To drill down into these outlooks, psychologists use a variety of questionnaires that capture perceptions, beliefs and feelings related to money. These tend to comprise sliding scales that measure things like the degree to which you favour saving for the future versus spending now, how anxious you feel about money, how hesitant you are in situations that involve it, and the extent to which you see finances as a means to show off and influence others. Some studies focus specifically on the concept of “love of money”. Here, the scale records things like how keen you are to be rich, how motivated you are by a desire for money, and how important, good and valuable you think it is.</p><p>Sesini recently led two major reviews of such research.In the first, she and a colleague analysed results from 226 papers exploring a range of potentially influential factors, such as age, personality, personal values and wealth. A few patterns were quite clear. For one, younger people tend to attribute greater importance to money and associate it more strongly with power and freedom. They are also more anxious about it – perhaps unsurprisingly, given rising student debts, unaffordable housing and stagnating salaries in many places.</p><p></p><p>How to alter your personality: why your character isn't fixed in stone</p><p>Traits like conscientiousness or extroversion might seem to define your character, but these aren't set in stone and new research reveals how anyone can change their personality – if they really want to</p><p></p><p>Some personality traits are influential, too. Neuroticism and conscientiousness, for example, can increase financial anxiety. Conscientious types are often less materialistic. And introverts are more likely than extroverts to view money as evil. There is also a link between “love of money” and unethical behaviours, such as lying and cheating. Other factors were less clear cut. Several studies (mostly in the US) indicated that wealthier people were more likely to believe money can solve all problems. However, a study in the UK concluded that such attitudes are more common among people on lower incomes.</p><p>In a second review, Sesini and her colleagueslooked at differences between men and women. Here, most of the 100 relevant studies had been conducted in the US, with a few in Europe and Asia. Together, they paint a puzzling picture. The men surveyed tended to see money as a way to control, influence and impress other people, and as a symbol of power and prestige – this was true for those in both higher-income and lower-income countries. Overall, they had higher “love of money” scores than women and were more likely to believe that becoming richer would make them more attractive and desirable.</p><p>The women’s attitudes were more complex. They were more likely to view money as a source of anxiety and stress – but also to associate it with security and love. The studies span a period from 1972 to 2021, but even the newer ones found these disparities, despite women having better work opportunities and greater financial independence in recent decades. “It may take time to fully appreciate the tangible effects of these changes,” says Sesini.</p><p>Your culture is just one factor that can influence how you view money</p><p>Bob Henry/Alamy</p><p>Culture, too, strongly influences attitudes to cash. Research into the psychological effects of money tends to beconcentrated on people living in WEIRD– Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic – countries. Last year, however,Danila Medvedevat the University of Chicago and his colleagues published work highlighting thedifferences between WEIRD and non-WEIRDcountries, specifically the US and UK versus China, India, Mexico and South Africa. The results were unexpected. “The basic intuition we have from an economic perspective is that someone from a less-wealthy country should be more motivated by a single dollar than someone from a wealthier country,” says Medvedev. “We show the opposite. And the effect gets stronger as we move to countries that are more dissimilar to the US.”</p><p>For WEIRD participants, work ethic was more tightly tied to monetary incentive. One particularly notable finding was that as soon as US participants had done enough to qualify for their base pay, over half of them quit the task, while more than 90 per cent of Mexicans continued with it. But Medvedev cautions that this could simply reflect a less contractual approach to work in non-WEIRD countries.</p><p>Research reveals why ostentatious displays of wealth often backfire</p><p>Although there is still more to learn about the factors that shape our individual attitudes to money, psychologists are also keen to work out how these viewsinfluence our behaviour and well-being. One key finding is that“love of money”attitudes are a problem. While having enough to comfortably provide for yourself and the people you love inoculates you from the downstream health impacts of financial stress,Gabrielle Pfundat Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, and her colleagues have found that your concept of wealth matters. The more value someone places on wealth, they found, the less likely people are to report feeling a sense of purpose, personal growth, self-acceptance, environmental mastery and life satisfaction, and the more negative emotions they tend to experience. Sesini’s work provides a clue as to why. It shows that people who view money as a sign of power, status and prestige tend to be more impulsive, less friendly and more Machiavellian – cunning, scheming and unscrupulous.</p><p>Research also reveals why ostentatious displays of wealth often backfire. Although studies indicate thatpeople tend to think flashing the cash will help them win friends, a team led byShalena Srnaat the University of Michiganfound the opposite. Participants in an online game of cooperation were less likely to choose partners who had dressed their avatar in a shirt featuring a designer logo, rather than an unbranded shirt – even if they had chosen branded clothing for their own avatar. “Wealth signalling reveals two things: that a person is wealthy and that they have decided to show off their wealth. It is the showing off that’s bad for your image as a cooperative person,” saysDeborah Smallat Yale University, who was part of the team.</p><p>Some think that signals of wealth and luxury will help them win friends</p><p>Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images</p><p>It is now well-established that being materialistic – having an excessive focus on acquiring wealth and possessions that display status – alsoundermines relationships. Research published last year might help explain this. WhenOlaya Moldesat Cardiff University in the UK exposed people to money-focused, status-related messages, such as ads for luxury brands, they hadhigher expectations of others– in particular, wanting them to be more attractive and more ambitious – which would seed dissatisfaction with the people around them. But being non-materialistic isn’t necessarily a better way to go. In their study on the influence of various factors on financial attitudes, Sesini and her colleague found that less materialistic people tend to have a “conservative, retentive” approach to money – some might call them “careful”, others would say “tight”. Either way, as well as being less likely to get into debt or end up bankrupt, they are also more likely to feel anxious about money, and more inclined to save in an “excessive and irrational way”.</p><p>Given such findings – and the apparent tightrope between having enough money and maintaining some sort of psychological distance from it – the million-dollar question is “What is a good attitude to the stuff?” Of course, there is no one right answer. Being aware of how money manipulates your behaviour and mind should help. The scientific literature also offers some pointers about how to get the most bang for your buck in wellness terms. If you have cash to spare,giving some to others will boost your happiness. So too willbuying experiences rather than things, but only if you can afford to do so. And using money to free up your time – like choosing the more expensive gym that is closer to your home, paying for supermarket deliveries or taking your family for a meal out on a Friday night, rather than spending hours chopping vegetables and washing dishes – will leave youfeeling more satisfied and less stressed. “Before buying that new pair of shoes or the latest gadget,” says Medvedev, “ask yourself: ‘Is this worth more to me than extra time or meaningful moments with loved ones?'”</p><p></p><p>The surprising benefits of anxiety and how you could harness them</p><p>There can be no doubt that extreme anxiety is highly debilitating, but at moderate levels, our nervous feelings can make us smarter problem solvers and fuel original thinking</p><p></p><p>Such advice will ring hollow if you are struggling to get by. Knowing that your brain is registering social pain and stress won’t help much either. Worse yet, psychologists have found thatpoverty impacts our cognitive function, undermining the ability to make good financial decisions. Nevertheless, research by Qiyan Ong at the National University of Singapore and her colleagues offers a ray of hope. They found that giving people a one-off debt-relief payment bothreduced stress and improved cognitive function, helping them escape the poverty trap.</p><p>Sesini, for her part, believes we can also all benefit from deeper personal exploration. “Ask yourself: ‘How do I feel when I think about money?'” she says. “This simple question can reveal a great deal about your relationship with money and offer valuable insights into your personal attitudes and emotions.” Talking about these insights could benefit romantic relationships and improve broader family dynamics, she adds. And while being more open about money might not prevent grumbles about tightness or profligacy, it might just help us break down some taboos. That can only be a good thing because, as my gossipy hairdresser highlighted, a reluctance to broach the subject of money is keeping many of us from sharing our honest perspectives with those we love.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>Red specks in the early universe are puzzling astronomers, but a proposed explanation suggests they are the progenitors of supermassive black holes</p><p>ByJonathan O’Callaghan</p><p>27 March 2025</p><p>ByJonathan O’Callaghan</p><p>A view of the early universe captured by the James Webb Space Telescope, including numerous little red dots whose nature is uncertain</p><p>NASA, ESA, CSA, Steve Finkelstein (UT Austin)</p><p>A mysterious class of small, red objects in the early universe might be explained byblack holesinside dense cocoons of gas, like a star.</p><p>Since launching in 2021, theJames Webb Space Telescope(JWST) has found hundreds of objects in the early universe that appear extremely red and compact, dubbedlittle red dots(LRDs).</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Why the big bang may not have been the beginning of the universe</p><p></p><p>About a billion years after the big bang, LRDs seem to vanish. This means they might be related to a process fairly early in the cosmos, and could be the progenitors of some galaxies – but their properties aren’t what astronomers expected.</p><p>“We thought we knew what the earliest galaxies would be like,” saysJillian Bellovaryat the American Museum of Natural History. “We did not think they would be like this. So we’re all just coming up with the weirdest possible ideas.”</p><p>Rohan Naiduat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleagues propose one such idea. They suggest some LRDs might be supermassive black holes that are surrounded by extremely dense gas comparable to the outer regions of a star’s atmosphere. The black holes would be eating this material voraciously, causing the gas to glow brightly.</p><p>Naidu and his colleagues identified an LRD in existence 660 million years after the big bang that they think fits this scenario. They declined to speak toNew Scientistabout the work while their paper is under review.</p><p>According to the team’s analysis, the ball of gas around the black hole would be slightly wider than Pluto’s orbit around our sun, with a mass millions of times that of our star. The black hole itself would have a hot, superheated disc of material around it, producing huge amounts of light and energy that burst through the cocoon of gas. From our point of view, that would appear as a little red dot.</p><p>“I personally really like the solution,” saysAnthony Taylorfrom the University of Texas at Austin. “It’s very elegant. It doesn’t [require] any exotic physics, and it doesn’t break the universe.”</p><p>Another team led byVadim Rusakovat the University of Manchester, UK, who also didn’t want to comment for this story, has put forward a similar explanation for LRDs in separate work. “They are all proposing this kind of embedded black hole in a very dense atmosphere,” saysXihan Jiat the University of Cambridge.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>A supermassive black hole is sending out a mysterious pulsing beat</p><p></p><p>There are other possible solutions. Bellovary suggests LRDs could be explained by black holesripping apart large groups of starsat the same time. “Little red dots have a lot of similar characteristics to a black hole eating a bunch of stars,” she says.</p><p>Alternatively, LRDs might be explained not by black holes, but by incredibly dense collections of stars. However, you would have to pack a huge amount of stars – equivalent to 10 billion suns – into a very small area to fit the observed properties. “You need to squeeze all this mass within 100 light years,” says Ji, making a cluster so dense “you expect the stars to collide with each other”. Only a few thousand stars are found within a similar distance from our sun.</p><p>If LRDs are explained by black holes, they could reveal how supermassive black holes – the extremely dense objects found at the centre of galaxies like our own – grew in the early universe. “It could finally answer how you make a supermassive black hole,” says Bellovary. “The earlier we look [in the universe], there’s still supermassive black holes. At some point they have to form. How the heck do you do that?”</p><p>Upcoming observations could help pin down an explanation. Several programmes to investigate LRDs in more detail have beenselected for JWST’s schedule over the next year,one of which is led by Taylor. He will be looking for bright lines representing emissions of calcium from LRDs that might point towards or against the black hole solution.</p><p>If stars are the culprit, “I’d expect to see these calcium lines”, he says. “However, if we see this cocoon of gas argument, it’s much less likely we would see these lines.”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>arXivDOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2503.16596</p><p>Reference:</p><p>arXivDOI:  10.48550/arXiv.2503.16595</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

Climate models assume that as the world warms, soil microbes that break down organic matter will do so more quickly, increasing the rate of CO2 emissions. Yet the same conditions might also trigger certain types of microbes found in soil, such as microalgae, to increase their rate of photosynthesis. This would result in a drawdown of more carbon from the atmosphere, partially mitigating the impact of CO2 being released by other processes.</p><p>Scientists are just starting to quantify the climate benefit of this effect. As part of this,Vincent Jasseyat the Center for Research on Biodiversity and Environment in France and his colleagues set out to measure the impact of photosynthesising microbes on the uptake of carbon in peatlands.</p><p>They transplanted 125 blocks of peat from five sites in Europe to expose the samples to new environmental conditions, and monitored the resulting microbial activity. The team found that warmer conditions triggered enhanced photosynthesis activity among microbes. “It’s a very strong response and it is similar across all the communities that we tested,” says Jassey.</p><p>The team used these results to build the first model that quantifies how much photosynthesising microbes could offset emissions from peat bogs on a global scale. They estimate it could amount to the drawdown of more than 51 million tonnes of carbon per year between 2021 and 2040, equivalent to about 14 per cent of the projected rise in peatland emissions over the same time frame. “I was really surprised to see how much carbon it could offset,” says Jassey.</p><p>Jean-Philippe Gibertat Duke University, North Carolina, says a similar effect has been observed in peatlands in Minnesota and Alaska. “I’ve seen enough – I’m convinced this is happening,” he says. “There is real possibility for this mitigation in one of the most important carbon sinks in terrestrial ecosystems on the planet.”The largest effect would probably be reserved for boreal and temperate peatlands, which are set to experience more dramatic swings in temperature, he adds.</p><p>The effect may not be limited to peatlands, though. “You find different species, but microalgae are everywhere in soils.

    <h1>What is vibe coding, should you be doing it, and does it matter?</h1>

        <p>The rise of large language models like ChatGPT that can churn out computer code has led to a new term - vibe coding - for people who create software by asking AI to do it for them</p><p>ByChris Stokel-Walker</p><p>27 March 2025</p><p></p><p>Getting an AI to write software for you? That’s vibe coding</p><p>ronstik/Alamy</p><p></p><p>Want to write software, but haven’t got the first clue where to start? Enter “vibe coding”, a term that has swept the internet to describe the use of AI tools, including large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, to generate computer code even if you can’t program.</p><p>“Vibe coding basically refers to using generative AI not just to assist with coding, but to generate the entire code for an app,” saysNoah Giansiracusaat Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts. Users ask, or prompt, LLM-based models such as ChatGPT, Claude or Copilot to produce the code for an app or service, and the AI system does all the work.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>The AI expert who says artificial general intelligence is nonsense</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The term was coined by Andrej Karpathy, a skilled software engineer who was head of AI at Tesla and a founding engineer at OpenAI – the maker of ChatGPT. In February, heposted on Xabout a “new kind of coding I call ‘vibe coding’”.</p><p>Karpathy described it as “where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists”. The term was born and the idea took hold. “That captured a moment that resonated with so many people, because there’s a whole bunch of people who are non-programmers who are starting to play with LLMs, writing code and getting amazing results out of them,” says Simon Willison, a software developer.</p><p>Software engineering can be a tricky thing to learn – and as a result, many people don’t bother. Vibe coding can help people with ideas for tools, apps and services to make them a reality without the challenge of learning the specifics of a programming language.</p><p>The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day.</p><p>“On the one hand it’s a gamechanger, because a lot of people are vibe coding, and over the course of a few prompting cycles you can get something that’s amazing and something that – for people who can’t program – it’s better than anything they could do on their own,” saysMatt Woodat Northumbria University, UK. But it can also result in incomplete, error-strewn software, he adds.</p><p>Opinion is split. “You’ve got all these people on LinkedIn and Twitter making outrageous claims that nobody needs to learn to program anymore,” says Willison, who believes that is overstating the power of vibe coding.</p><p>“My sense is that this is a promising direction that will get a lot better and that we’ll see a lot more of in the near future, but at present it’s a bit limited and has some reliability issues,” says Giansiracusa. The code produced can often be buggy, and because the people prompting it don’t have the inherent knowledge to fix it, they are overly reliant on the same LLMs that made the errors to fix them.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Capital letter test is a foolproof way of sorting AIs from humans</p><p></p><p>One of the big claims about AI is its ability to take our jobs. But there is little evidence that vibe coding will replace software engineers – despite some social media boasts. “It’s not going to replace programmers,” says Wood.</p><p>“I feel like the job of a software engineer is to produce software that works,” says Willison. “One of the reasons I don’t think we’re going to be put out of our jobs by these systems is actually, a huge amount of the work that we do with software engineers has nothing to do with typing the code.”</p><p>Topics:</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

This approach has been adopted by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), whichlaunched a toolcalled the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System last month.</p><p>But this gradual expansion of AI’s role in weather prediction has fallen short of replacing all traditional number-crunching – something a new model created byRichard Turnerat the University of Cambridge and his colleagues seeks to change.</p><p>Turner says previous work was limited to forecasting, and passed over a step called initialisation, where data from satellites, balloons and weather stations around the world is collated, cleaned, manipulated and merged into an organised grid that the forecast can start from. “That’s actually half the computational resources,” says Turner.</p><p>The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day.</p><p>The researchers created a model called Aardvark Weather that, for the first time, replaces both the forecast and initialisation stages.

But he concedes that AI models like his also rely entirely on those physics-based models for training. “It absolutely doesn’t work if you take their training data away and just use the observational data to train off,” he says. “We did try to do that, and go completely physics model-free, but that didn’t work.”</p><p>He believes the future of weather forecasting may be scientists working on ever-more accurate physics-based models, which are then used to train AI models that replicate their output faster and with less hardware. Some are even more optimistic about the prospects of AI.</p><p>Nikita Gourianovat the University of Oxford believes that, in time, AI will be able to create weather forecasts that actually surpass NWP. These will be trained on observational and historical weather data alone, creating accurate forecasts entirely independent of NWP, he says. “It’s a question of scale, but also a question of cleverness. You have to be clever with how you feed the data in – and how you structure the neural network.”</p><p></p><p>Journal reference:</p><p>NatureDOI: 10.1038/s41586-025-08897-0</p><p></p><p>Topics:</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

    <h1>We’re finally learning how perimenopause profoundly changes the brain</h1>

        <p>The hormonal upheaval in the run-up to menopause can cause cognitive difficulties. But researchers are also finding that this can be a critical window for protecting long-term brain health</p><p>ByLinda Geddes</p><p>20 March 2025</p><p>ByLinda Geddes</p><p>The first sign something was amiss was the tiredness. Then I started forgetting where I had left my phone or keys, only to find them in the fridge or kitchen cupboard. The breaking point came when I went to make a cup of tea before an important interview, only to return 45 minutes later to a string of increasingly irritated emails asking why I wasn’t on the call. I had been potting houseplants instead.</p><p>As a woman in my early 40s, I was aware of this thing called perimenopause looming. But were my symptoms related to this, or just a product of getting older, or simply down to the mental load of juggling work, family and social demands?</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>New evidence finally reveals how male and female brains really differ</p><p></p><p>Teasing out what is perimenopause and what is just life is difficult, but the run-up tomenopausecan bring some alarming symptoms – not least cognitive ones, such as difficulty recalling names, trouble concentrating and putting keys in the fridge.</p><p>“We now know that up to 62 per cent of all perimenopausal and postmenopausal women report these [cognitive symptoms], which can be so severe as to spark fears around early-onset dementia,” saysLisa Mosconi, director of the Women’s Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.</p><p>Though long ignored or dismissed as inevitable consequences of ageing, the neurological manifestations of menopause are finally drawing scientific interest. It is increasingly clear brain changes occur during this period – and that some can ultimately be positive. More than that, these changes demonstrate that menopause may offer a crucial window for protecting brain health. The question is how.</p><p>Menopause occurs when a person with a uterus stops menstruating and their ovaries stop producing significant amounts ofoestrogenandprogesterone, the two main sex hormones that regulate female reproduction. This usually happens between the ages of about 45 and 55, but it can also happen earlier, whether naturally or because of the removal or impairment of the ovaries. Perimenopause is the warm-up to this transition, beginning up to a decade before a woman’s final period.</p><p>The brain is closely connected to the ovaries via a network of glands, and many brain regions possess receptors for reproductive hormones, allowing those hormones to directly influence brain function, development and cognition. The most studied of these is oestradiol, the primary form of the oestrogen hormone that is produced during women’s reproductive years. In the brain, it protects neurons from damage, stimulates the growth of new ones and interacts with neurotransmitters involved in concentration, processing information and regulating emotions.</p><p></p><p>What the new field of women’s neuroscience reveals about female brains</p><p>Neuroscientist-turned-entrepreneur Emilė Radytė is using brain stimulation to explore how things like premenstrual syndrome and period pain impact the brain</p><p></p><p>“During menopause we have this profound loss of oestradiol in particular, and these oestrogen receptors in the brain, they’re sort of starved for attention,” saysLiisa Galea, who studies sex hormones and cognition at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada.</p><p>However, these hormones don’t simply disappear overnight. “It’s a very volatile process where the system fails, then a kind of backup generator kicks in and works for a while, and then the system fails again, which is why you have these massive and very volatile hormonal fluctuations,” saysClaudia Barth, a neuroscientist at Diakonhjemmet Hospital in Oslo, Norway.</p><p>The brain doesn’t respond well to such fluctuations. “We don’t like hormonal surges, we don’t like hormonal withdrawal,” saysPauline Maki, director of the Women’s Mental Health Research Program at the University of Illinois in Chicago. “That variability also likely contributes to the memory problems that many women experience during perimenopause.”</p><p>Brain scan of a 62-year-old woman who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease four years previously</p><p>Zephyr/Science Photo Library</p><p>The “brain fog” that many women report during perimenopause is real: studies consistently demonstrate that there is a small but measurable decline in the ability to learn, and to recall both new information, such as recently made appointments, and previously known information, such as your spouse’s name. While cognitive performance remains within normal limits for most women during this phase – and on par with men of the same age – around 1 in 10 experienceclinically significant impairment. The transition is also accompanied by structural changes in the brain. “We and others have found alterations in brain structure, metabolism, connectivity and biochemistry in many parts of the brain, including regions vulnerable to Alzheimer’s,” says Mosconi.</p><p>But are the symptoms of cognitive impairment, as well as the structural changes to the brain, temporary, or could they have longer-term consequences? Answering this question has taken decades, in part because of the chronic lack of funding for research into women’s health. “People will say, ‘It’s a niche area; it’s not important to study because it only happens to a subset of the population’,” says Galea. “Which is hilarious, because we are 50 per cent of the population.”</p><p>The field also experienced a significant setback in the early 2000s, after a major trial exploring the effects ofhormone replacement therapy (HRT)nearly brought research into the menopausal brain to a standstill.</p><p>For women going through menopause, HRT involves taking a combination of oestrogen and progestogen, a hormone that mimics progesterone and reduces the risk of uterine cancers; because oestrogen can, over time, encourage the problematic build-up of the uterine lining and increase cancer risk,oestrogen aloneis only offered to women who have had their uterus removed. Through the 1980s and 90s, small studies indicated thatoestrogen replacement improved memoryand reduced anxiety in menopausal women;observational researchsuggested HRT might be protective againstAlzheimer’s disease, which istwice as common in women as it is in menand tends to result in more severe symptoms. In 2000, Maki and her colleague Susan Resnik found thatoestrogen replacement therapy boosted blood flowin areas of the brain associated with memory performance, more so than in women not taking exogenous oestrogen; this was, she says, the first direct evidence linking sex hormones and memory function in women.</p><p>Meanwhile, theWomen’s Health Initiative (WHI)trials, a large-scale effort to establish whether HRT was beneficial for long-term health, were under way. Maki, who was involved with this work, expected these studies to confirm the beneficial effects of hormone therapy. Instead, in July 2000, WHI investigators announced that they were stopping the main trial three years early: data suggested that HRT was associated witha small but significant increasein the risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer, whilean ancillary study found a substantial increasein the risk of dementia and cognitive decline.</p><p></p><p>Should you take HRT? Here's how to think clearly about the risks</p><p>Hormone replacement therapy has a bad reputation because of potential risks to long-term health. A new look at the evidence could change our relationship with HRT – and the menopause</p><p></p><p>“This wasn’t just a study of a few people – it was thousands of people, billions of dollars, published in a high-impact journal. So it was big news,” saysMichael Craig, a consultant psychiatrist at the National Female Hormone Clinic at the Maudsley Hospital in London. The effect was immediate: “Overnight, everyone came off HRT, and the funding for this area disappeared.”</p><p>Though the failed trials set HRT research back, they did reveal important nuances in how sex hormones work in the brain. We now know that the type of oestrogen matters significantly. That used in the WHI trials was derived from the urine of pregnant horses and mostly consisted of oestrone, a relatively weak form of the hormone. Galea’s research has since shown that giving oestrone to rats that had their ovaries removed to mimic menopause reduced the number of new neurons in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved in memory-making, learning and emotional regulation. Giving oestradiol, which binds more strongly to oestrogen receptors than other forms of the hormone, however,increased them.Further animal studiesshow that administering progestogen alongside oestradiol inhibits that neuronal growth – painting a complex picture of both the effect of sex hormones on the brain and how to manipulate that effect.</p><p>The WHI study also demonstrated that the timing of HRT is significant. When the study launched, most women started the therapy in their early 50s. But most of the trial participants, who hadn’t previously been on HRT, were in their 60s and 70s, sometimes decades past their last period. This was largely for statistical reasons: if you want to establish whether HRT prevents age-related conditions such as Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disease, you will be waiting a long time to find out if your participants are only just starting to go through menopause at the time of their recruitment.</p><p>More recent evidence indicates, however, that there might be a “window of opportunity” for preventing dementia, and that some HRT is beneficial if started at the onset of menopause symptoms or soon after.A 2023 systematic reviewexamining data from 51 studies found that women who started oestrogen-only therapy within 10 years of their final menstruation were at significantly decreased risk of Alzheimer’s later in life, compared with women who didn’t have HRT.</p><p>“The theory is that during this period, the brain may be more receptive to the positive effects of exogenous oestrogen on brain health, potentially slowing cognitive decline,” says Mosconi, the senior study author. “Starting hormone therapy much later, specifically more than a decade after menopause, does not seem to provide the same cognitive benefits and could carry higher risks.”</p><p></p><p>How a new kind of vaccine could lead to the eradication of Alzheimer’s</p><p>Promising new vaccines are designed to be given to patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. If they perform well in clinical trials, they have the potential to one day rid society of dementia</p><p></p><p>In the decades since the end of the WHI trials, a tide of evidence has swept away many of the concerns aboutthe safety of HRT– particularly for modern formulations – while menopause awareness campaigns and celebrity endorsements have encouraged greater discussion about the risks and benefits of the therapy.Most research since the WHI studyhas underscored that HRT, especially in women starting the therapy before age 65, is unlikely to increase dementia or cognitive impairment risks, and that other health risks of HRT should be weighed against its overall benefits. And though research into HRT’seffects on cognitive symptoms is ongoing, many women report that the therapy gave them back their sense of self.</p><p>Nuvelle, a combined hormone replacement therapy drug</p><p>Dr P. Marazzi/Science Photo Library</p><p>However, the idea of prescribing HRT for dementia prevention alone isn’t yet recommended – not least because it is unclear who would benefit. For one thing, oestrogen-only therapy, which seems to carry the most protective benefits, is recommended solely for women who have had a hysterectomy. And though around two-thirds of women who go through menopause experience cognitive challenges during that time, only around20 per cent of them go on to develop Alzheimer’s. In most cases, the memory deficits many women experience during the menopause transitioneventually resolve themselves.</p><p>“Obviously in the moment, it sucks for the woman who is having a hard time adjusting, but after it’s done, the brain should be able to recover,” saysNicole Gervais, a neuroscientist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.</p><p>But for some women – particularly those whose brains might be more vulnerable to the menopausal drop in oestradiol – recovering from what should be temporary challenges might be more difficult. Identifying these women will help researchers determine who may be at a higher risk of developing dementia and investigate whether targeted interventions, including HRT, could help.</p><p>So far, studies suggest thatboth early and induced menopausemay be associated with a higher risk of dementia, compared with women who experience it naturally in their 40s or 50s. Menopause can be induced surgically, by the removal of the ovaries, or medically, in the course of treating other conditions. “They also experience more severe menopause symptoms, probably because the brain experiences more of a shock,” says Gervais. Those carrying genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease may also be less resilient during the time around menopause. For some women,chronic stressandsleep deprivation– whether as a result of the demands of life or associated with changes during this transition, or both – can also play a role in the development of dementia.</p><p>“Menopause offers a valuable opportunity to identify and address these vulnerabilities before the disease has a chance to take hold,” says Mosconi.</p><p></p><p>Gene variant that raises Alzheimer's risk may boost fertility in women</p><p>The genetic variant APOE4 substantially raises the risk of Alzheimer's disease, but it has also been linked to women having more children in an Indigenous group in Bolivia</p><p></p><p>One promising approach could be to focus on specific symptoms. Hot flushes are a common menopause symptom thought to stem from the effects of declining oestrogen on the brain region that controls body temperature. Maki’s research suggests that more severe hot flushes, particularly if they continue for many years, are associated with poorer memory performance, tiny stroke-like lesions in the brain and theaccumulation of proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease. This may imply that hot flushes directly impact memory circuits in the brain; treating hot flushes might affect the progression of cognitive decline.</p><p>Researchers are also investigating selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), drugs that mimic the effects of the hormone in some parts of the body, but not others. Mosconi is currently involved in trials ofPhytoSERM, which is designed to trigger oestrogen receptors in the brain without affecting those in the uterus. If effective, this could negate the need for women to take progesterone and raise the possibility of using oestrogen protectively.</p><p>Besides oestrogen, other hormones are also affected by the menopause transition,including follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH stimulates the ovaries to mature eggs each month and to produce oestrogen; as women’s supply of eggs dwindles and levels of oestrogen drop, FSH levels climb higher in response and remain elevated even once menopause is over. Animal studies have suggested that this hormonal shift could contribute topost-menopausal weight gainandbone loss, prompting efforts to develop an FSH-blocking antibody to improve bone health and reduce weight gain. However, FSH receptors are also abundant in the brain – implying that FSH also plays a role in cognitive function.</p><p>Over the past five years,Mone Zaidiat Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and neuroscientistKeqiang Yeat Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology in China have been exploring whether FSH-blocking antibodies could also influence the development of Alzheimer’s in mice that are bred to be genetically prone to the disease. So far,their data seems to suggest that it does. Zaidi and Ye’s studies in female mice that had their ovaries removed showed that FSH accelerated the buildup of amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles associated with Alzheimer’s in their brains, speeding up cognitive decline;blocking FSH, however, decreased Alzheimer’s symptomsin the mice.</p><p></p><p>We may finally know how cognitive reserve protects against Alzheimer's</p><p>Why does mental effort lead to a more resilient brain that can withstand dementia and decline? We are now discovering the mechanisms behind this cognitive reserve, opening up new ways to boost it</p><p></p><p>“We’re not disputing that reduced oestrogen may contribute to memory loss, but high levels of FSH post-menopause may also play a direct role in memory loss, particularly spatial memory and recognition memory,” says Zaidi, who hopes to begin safety trials of the antibody in humans later this year.</p><p>Ye points out that there is a period during early perimenopause when oestrogen levels are relatively stable, but FSH is rising sharply: “During this period, there is a transient decline in cognitive performance, especially verbal memory,” he says. It is possible that FSH, rather than oestrogen, is to blame.</p><p>Most experts agree that conventional HRT, particularly when initiated at the start of menopausal symptoms, is an effective way of combating the short-term cognitive symptoms associated with perimenopause. Early initiation of HRT could also help keep FSH levels in check, says Ye.</p><p>After my morning spent repotting plants and not on my work call, I started speaking with older female friends about the problems that I had been experiencing. They reassured me that it wasn’t, in fact, early-onset dementia; several suggested trying HRT. I have been taking oestrogen and progestogen for the past two years and I am pleased to report that I am feeling much more like my old self – and haven’t discovered any keys nested amongst the yoghurt pots for some time.</p><p></p><p>These four common medicines could help prolong your life</p><p>Taking Viagra, HRT, a statin or a painkiller was linked to a slightly lower chance of people dying over a 12-year study, suggesting the drugs may have life-extending properties</p><p></p><p>That said, HRT isn’t a solution for everyone, which is why exploring alternatives such as blocking FSH is important. There are also non-hormonal ways that women can reduce their risk of developing dementia, including eating more healthily, getting regular exercise, reducing stress and alcohol consumption, and not smoking. Helpfully, these same strategies can reduce many troublesome menopause symptoms.</p><p>However, despite its challenges, menopause isn’t some looming monster we should fear. In fact, the neuronal rewiring that occurs during this transition might even be beneficial, with women emerging from it enjoying a more stable mood and improved emotional well-being.</p><p>“Many experts, myself included, believe that menopause is actually a renovation project on the brain,” says Mosconi. “After menopause, all those neurons and connections between neurons that were needed to support ovulation and enable a pregnancy are no longer needed and can be discarded. It’s the brain’s chance to get ‘leaner and meaner’, if you will. This can lead to some glitches – but also has some advantages.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>Floating platforms of wood could draw up seawater and help it to freeze, seeding the formation of new sea ice</p><p>ByChris Simms</p><p>24 March 2025</p><p>ByChris Simms</p><p>Sea ice coverage in the Arctic has rapidly declined due to global warming</p><p>Arterra Picture Library / Alamy</p><p>Modified floating wood could seed the formation of newsea icein the Arctic, helping counteract the rapid decline of ice coverage due to global warming.</p><p>The area of the Arctic Ocean covered by ice is shrinking as the climate warms, and it has been projected that the region will see itsfirst ice-free summer daybefore 2030. The loss of ice leads to a vicious cycle; because the exposed water is darker than ice, it absorbs more of the sun’s heat, warming the water further and making it increasingly hard for ice to reform. This has led people to suggest various geoengineering plans to refreeze the water both in the Arctic andAntarctica.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Antarctica is in crisis and we are scrambling to understand its future</p><p></p><p>Now,Tian Liat Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and her colleagues are proposing modifying wood to help it seed the formation of new ice.</p><p>“We choose wood because it’s a natural material,” says Li. “You see a lot of floating wood in ocean water and it raises much less of an environmental concern than things made of artificial materials.”</p><p>To create the modified material, which they call ice-wood, the researchers took a 10-centimetre-square, 1.5-centimetre-thick piece of American basswood (Tilia americana) and cut a small chunk out of the middle. This chunk was placed on a hotplate so that one side carbonised, while the larger piece was treated with hydrogen peroxide and heat, removing much of a polymer called lignin. The two pieces were then put back together.</p><p>Lignin gives wood its colour, so removing it makes that part of the wood whiter and better at reflecting light. The idea is that when the ice-wood floats in the sea, water is drawn up through natural microchannels. Sunlight then warms the dark, carbonised part of the surface, making the water there evaporate, after which it recondenses on the colder, whiter part of the surface.</p><p>The height of the ice-wood and its white surface allow it to stay colder than the water, says Li. “The wood essentially sucks water from the bottom and pumps it to the top, where there is a sub-freezing platform, where ice begins to form.”</p><p>During tests in ponds with water kept at about 2°C (36°F), the top of a piece of floating ice-wood stayed below freezing, even when the ambient air temperature reached between 7°C and 8°C (44.6°F and 46.4°F). “It acts like an ice seed – we see ice start to form from the edge and extending to the other areas,” says Li.</p><p>But this probably wouldn’t work to seed new ice in the Arctic summer because the air temperature typically reaches around 10°C, saysCecilia Bitzat the University of Washington in Seattle.</p><p>Li and her colleagues also modelled how the use of ice-wood throughout the Arctic from 2005 to 2022 would have affected the amount of sea ice. By the melting season of 2022, their model indicates that covering the oceans and coastlines of the Arctic with ice-wood would have boosted the ice growth rate by 0.3 centimetres a day and cut sea surface temperatures there by about 3°C (5.4°F) compared with real 2022 levels.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Five climate megaprojects that might just save the world</p><p></p><p>Covering the whole Arctic isn’t realistic, but Li suggests that larger pieces of ice-wood could be used around coastal regions, where Indigenous people rely on ice to hunt fish, to accelerate the ice coverage in winter and reduce ice loss in summer.</p><p>Scaling up the process shouldn’t be a problem, says Li. As well as being environmentally friendly, wood is a cheap material, and the process of removing lignin is already done at large scales in factories to make white paper, she says.</p><p>Being able to access the chosen regions of the Arctic will also be important, saysShaun Fitzgeraldat the University of Cambridge, who is investigating various ways of restoring Arctic ice. He would like to know how this approach will stack up against other proposed interventions, such aspumping seawater onto snow to encourage new ice to form.</p><p>But a big question remains about whether our focus should be on geoengineering approaches to prevent ice loss or on slowing the climate change that is causing it.</p><p>“I find it strange to put so much energy into these ideas when we already know what is needed: reduced carbon dioxide emissions,” saysJulienne Stroeveat University College London.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Research SquareDOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-3712042/v1</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

It depends on various fast feedback effects that occur when temperatures rise, such as increases in water vapour in the atmosphere andchanges in cloud behaviour. Studies suggest that the equilibrium climate sensitivity could be anywhere from 2°C to 5°C, but for models run beyond 2100 it has been assumed to be 3°C.</p><p>Unmissable news about our planet delivered straight to your inbox every month.</p><p>Ganopolski and his team instead tweaked their model to explore what the impact would be if the equilibrium climate sensitivity differs from this expectation.</p><p>Their model also includesadditional and longer-term carbon feedback effectssuch as the release of CO2 and methane from permafrost and wetlands. Previous models looking beyond 2100 haven’t included both CO2 and methane feedbacks, says Ganopolski.</p><p>Including both can have a big impact, he says, because higher CO2 leads to more methane being released and vice versa.</p><p>For an assumed equilibrium sensitivity of 3°C, the team’s results are similar to those of other studies, leading to warming of around 3°C just after 2200 for a moderate-emissions scenario.

        <p>We’ve pumped huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that needs to be paid back. Large animals like wolves, bison and whales may already be tackling the problem</p><p>ByGraham Lawton</p><p>24 March 2025</p><p>ByGraham Lawton</p><p>Daniel Mîrlea</p><p>In the Țarcu mountains of Romania, a pioneering experiment is changing the atmosphere aroundrewilding. Starting in 2014, around 100 European bison were gradually reintroduced to the area, having been wiped out by hunting more than 200 years ago. They now number more than 170 and graze over some 48 square kilometres. That is a success story in itself. But there is more to this project than just bringing back the big beasts. Their domain has also become a carbon hoover, sucking an estimated 200,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide out of the air every year, equivalent to taking 43,000 petrol cars off the road.</p><p>The bison themselves aren’t a significant carbon sink. It is their influence on the widerenvironment– compacting soil, dispersing seeds and creating varied habitats through their browsing – that has turbocharged its ability to absorb carbon. The area in which they roam is now soaking up 10 times the amount that it was before the bison were reintroduced.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Is a broken jet stream causing extreme weather that lasts longer?</p><p></p><p>The Țarcu mountains experiment is the first test of a concept thatOswald Schmitz, an ecologist at Yale University, claims has the potential to restore the atmosphere to an earlier state and hence help to arrestclimate change. Schmitz and his collaborators argue that if similar projects were rolled out across the globe, both on land and in the sea, a significant amount of carbon would just disappear.</p><p>These researchers are now building their evidence base and honing their plans. Meanwhile, though, some climate scientists have raised concerns that attempts to put rewilding at the heart ofclimate mitigationcould backfire. So how do Schmitz’s claims really stack up?</p><p>A solution to the climate crisis demands two things. First and foremost, that we stop emittinggreenhouse gases, or at least get emissions down tonet zeroby 2050. Second, that we remove the huge amount of CO2we have pumped into the atmosphere over the past century or so. Fail on either front and we have no chance of keeping the global average temperature rise to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. This would be catastrophic.</p><p>The first of these demands is difficult, but doable. How we might achieve the second is less clear. According to Schmitz, to pay back our legacy carbon debt, we need to remove at least 6.5 gigatonnes of CO2a year, every year, from now until 2100. Existing methods of drawing carbon down from the atmosphere, if expanded to their maximum capacity, would only be able to remove 6 gigatonnes a year, says Schmitz. Less, if we also need to use them to offset ongoing emissions.</p><p>A growing pile of evidence supports the idea that animals are powerful drivers of carbon capture</p><p>Those existing methods are largely nature-based, such as protecting habitats and planting living carbon sinks –trees, mangroves and seaweeds. There are also technological fixes, such asenhanced rock weathering, where rocks are crushed to dust to increase the rate at which they absorb CO2, ordirect air capture, where CO2is pulled out of the atmosphere by huge machines. But these are emerging technologies that may never actually mature.</p><p>The upshot is that, even if we reach net zero by 2050, we appear to still be, at the very least, 500 million tonnes short on CO2removal per year for the next 75 years.</p><p>According to Schmitz, however, this is much less of a problem than it appears, because a powerful but overlooked nature-based solution is already making up much of that shortfall and could even solve the whole problem on its own: wild animals.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>How the healing powers of botany can reduce anxiety and boost health</p><p></p><p>Until recently, animals weren’t considered part of the solution at all. Compared with land plants and seaweed, the amount of carbon stored in animal bodies is minuscule, accounting for just 0.3 per cent of all the biomass on Earth, according to a2018 analysis. But around 10 years ago, Schmitz started to think that this might be an oversight.</p><p>He was researching an ecological concept called trophic cascades, which holds that ecosystems are primarily shaped from the top down by the feeding behaviour of “apex consumers” – large herbivores and carnivores. Herbivores influence the make-up of vegetation, which fundamentally alters how the ecosystem works. They, in turn, are controlled by their predators, so predators also influence vegetation. Exactly how depends on the context. But, in general, if you take the large animals out of an ecosystem, you radically alter it, usually for the worse.</p><p>At the same time, research from the Serengeti plains of East Africa and the American prairies was finding that grazing by wildebeest and bison altered nutrient cycles, especially how much carbon could be locked away by plants. “And so I connected the dots,” says Schmitz. “It dawned on me that having animals in the system can transform what the vegetation looks like and should thereby also be able to transform how much carbon is taken up.” In 2014, he and his collaborators published the idea and coined a term for harnessing animals’ underappreciated influence on carbon storage:animating the carbon cycle, or ACC for short.</p><p>They point to a growing pile of evidence to support their claims that animals are unrecognised but powerful drivers of carbon capture. On the Serengeti, for example, 1.2 million blue wildebeest range over a vast area, browsing and defecating as they go. By keeping the grass trim, they reduce the frequency and intensity of wildfires, which release stored carbon from the soil. Much of their carbon-rich dung ends up in long-term storage underground, buried by insects. Together, these actions allow the Serengeti ecosystem to store 4.4 million tonnes more CO2each year than it would in the absence of wildebeest.</p><p>In the Pacific Ocean, meanwhile,sea otters protect kelp forestsby feeding on herbivorous urchins that, if left to their own devices, devastate the kelp. The sea otter population of the US and Canada – which has rebounded from near-extinction after being mercilessly hunted for their fur – leads to the capture of 5.2 million tonnes of CO2a year.</p><p>Sea otters protect kelp forests by feeding on urchins</p><p>Michael S. Nolan/Alamy</p><p>A few million tonnes of CO2isn’t going to make much of a difference, but many other animals create carbon-sinking ecosystems, and it all adds up. Indeed, Schmitz estimates that existing populations of wildebeest, sea otters and five other species – muskox, grey wolves, tiger sharks, lemon sharks and blacktip reef sharks – already collectively stimulate the storage of 300 million tonnes of CO2a year. Which is a bit more like it. That sort of figure goes quite a long way towards filling the gap between the conventionally calculated carbon capture potential of nature-based solutions and what we need to remove from the atmosphere to avoid climate catastrophe. And there’s more. If you take into account existing populations of all marine fish, the amount of annual carbon capture and storage attributable to wild animals increases almost 20 times.</p><p>Fish have a “tremendous” impact on carbon storage, says Schmitz. “Part of it is in just the sheer biomass of these animals,” he says. But bony fish also fix carbon into insoluble minerals in their intestines as part of their way of dealing withconstantly ingesting seawater. “It’s a sort of rock-like substance that they poop out and that sinks to the ocean bottom really quickly,” says Schmitz. Collectively,marine fish account for the storage of a whopping 5.5 gigatonnes of carbon each year.</p><p>Schmitz and his collaborators estimate that, taken together, this group of animals alone – wildebeest, sea otters, muskox, grey wolves, sharks and other marine fish – are already taking 5.8 gigatonnes of CO2out of the atmosphere each year, not far off the overall 6.5 gigatonnes a year legacy CO2debt.</p><p>That’s a massive contribution, and one that Schmitz says isn’t accounted for in the global carbon budget. If he is right, we have overestimated how much legacy carbon we need to remove because animals are already doing most of it, unnoticed and unsung. “What we need to do is incorporate what the animals currently provide in [carbon] accounting,” says Schmitz. “But because we’re not, we’re maybe letting an important ingredient of ecosystems disappear and that puts us further in the hole. So we need to conserve what we have.”</p><p>As for the rest – 700 million tonnes – that may be achieved by expanding the existing natural methods of CO2removal. Or else Schmitz calculates that much of it could be taken care of by putting apex consumers back into the ecosystems from which they have been removed, known as trophic rewilding.</p><p>A key part of that calculation is a methodology for estimating how much carbon a given rewilding project would remove from the atmosphere, called the Yale/GRA ACC model (GRA stands for the Global Rewilding Alliance, which has funded a lot of Schmitz’s work). “We’re taking the classic principles of carbon cycling – that is, carbon uptake through photosynthesis and carbon recycling because of plants dying and going into the soil – and layering herbivores feeding on the plants on that, and then carnivores feeding on the herbivores,” he says. Using that tool to analyse theȚarcu mountains bison project, Schmitz and his collaborators were able to estimate the carbon impact – subsequently measured by taking samples in the field – to a fair degree of accuracy.</p><p>Apex predators like wolves can alter how ecosystems work</p><p>Shutterstock/Michal Ninger</p><p>They have calculated that trophic rewilding of just seven further species around the world would add another 600 million tonnes of carbon drawdown a year. These are forest elephants, American bison and five species of baleen whale: blue, fin, humpback, southern right and Antarctic minke. They wouldn’t need to be brought back to their full, historical populations or ranges, but to something like their status before the industrial revolution, says Schmitz. That means around 500,000 African forest elephants (up from less than 100,000 today), 2 million American bison (up from 30,000 today) and 188,000 baleen whales in the Southern Ocean.</p><p>To start making ACC happen at scale, Schmitz and his colleagues are now applying the carbon storage methodology to numerous other existing and potential rewilding projects worldwide, all with a view to figuring out which would have the biggest impact.</p><p>“We’ve got case studies in different habitats and on different continents, deliberately diverse ones,” saysAlister Scottat the Global Rewilding Alliance. “The idea is, what are the 50 or 60 or 70 locations around the world that hold the most promise for helping to stabilise the global climate by helping nature’s recovery?” The hope is that this “hotspots” study will lend support to the case for a global rollout of ACC. Some countries are even looking at incorporating rewilding gains into their legally-binding plans for reducing carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, according to Scott.</p><p>Such grand plans, however, make some scientists nervous. “Clearly, animals play really important roles in nutrient cycling, including carbon cycling,” saysEthan Duvallat Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, co-author of acritiqueof ACC published in August 2024. “But we shouldn’t overstate their importance in climate change mitigation. We have limited science at this point on select species and select systems.”</p><p>What isn’t taken into account, says Duvall, is that some species in some ecosystems – savannah elephants, for example – actually result in an overall release of carbon into the atmosphere. “The reality is that when it comes to carbon, not every animal is doing the same thing and not every system is doing the same thing,” he says. “It’s not an inevitable outcome of functionally intact and biodiverse systems to store carbon.”</p><p></p><p>How climate change has pushed our oceans to the brink of catastrophe</p><p>For decades, the oceans have absorbed much of the excess heat caused by greenhouse gases. The latest observations suggest they are reaching their limits, so how worried should we be?</p><p></p><p>His concern is that people will jump to the conclusion that all rewilding projects are carbon negative when they aren’t. He likens it to tree planting, which was once seen as a climate panacea, but turned out to bemore complicated and context dependent. Dark foliage can have a warming effect by soaking up sunlight that would otherwise be reflected, for instance.</p><p>The guardians of the carbon budget aren’t buying it either. “He is claiming that rewilding upper trophic mammals could induce large carbon storage in vegetation and soil,” saysPierre Friedlingsteinat the University of Exeter’s Global Systems Institute in the UK, which publishes anannual report on the state of the world’s carbon. “That’s true in theory, and there is some evidence of increased carbon storage locally, for example in South Africa.” However, Friedlingstein disputes the claim that animals are already drawing down vast amounts of unaccounted-for carbon. “Wildlife preservation is, of course, important for biodiversity, but not for climate change.”</p><p>Schmitz acknowledges that not all rewilding projects will draw down carbon, but he insists that isn’t a problem because we can just focus on those that do. That is exactly why he and his collaborators are working to identify the specific contexts in which trophic rewilding is worthwhile. “If we’re going to rewild, let’s rewild,” says Schmitz. “But then let’s measure the relevant ecosystem components as we go and learn by doing. This is win-win conservation.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>Birds do it, chimps do it, even monarch butterflies do it – and by paying more attention to how animals self-medicate, we can find new treatments for ourselves</p><p>ByGraham Lawton</p><p>17 March 2025</p><p>ByGraham Lawton</p><p>Becki Gill</p><p>Two decades ago,Jaap de Roodemade a discovery that changed his scientific career. While researching the ecology and evolution of parasites and their hosts, he came across something truly surprising: the monarch butterflies he was studying seemed to be exploiting the medicinal properties of plants to treat themselves and their offspring.</p><p>Back then, the notion that an insect might be capable of self-medicating seemed far-fetched. Now, de Roode is a world expert in the burgeoning field of animal medication, with a lab of his own at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He spoke toNew Scientistabout his work, his new book,Doctors by Nature: How ants, apes and other animals heal themselves, and his belief that animals possess medicinal knowledge that we can use to improve our own health.</p><p>The self-medicating behaviour of chimps and woolly bear caterpillars (below) have also been studied</p><p>Michael A Huffman</p><p>Graham Lawton: How did this unlikely area of research get going?</p><p>Jaap de Roode: It started during work in Tanzania in the 1980s with a chance observation. Michael Huffman of Kyoto University was working with Mohamedi Seifu Kalunde, a national parks ranger, to look at the role of elderly chimpanzees in society. While tracking one called Chausiku, they noticed that she was withdrawn, she was taking naps during the day and she had diarrhoea. They saw her go to a plant calledVernonia, also known as bitter leaf. She stripped off the bark and started sucking the pith. This is not normally part of their diet. Seifu, who was also a traditional healer, told Huffman that he uses it as a medicinal plant. The next day, they saw Chausiku had recovered. That was the moment Huffman thought, well, maybe she is using medication.</p><p>Was she?</p><p>A lot of studies followed to figure that out. They looked at every step. Was a chimp sick? Does the plant have medicinal properties? If chimpanzees are sick and use this plant, does it help them? They found there are chemicals in this plant that kill intestinal worms. So, yeah,it’s a medicinal plant, and chimpanzees use it when they are sick.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Orangutan is first non-human seen treating wounds with medicinal plant</p><p></p><p>Woolly bear caterpillar</p><p>Michael Singer</p><p>That was the first proven example. Any others?</p><p>People including Jane Goodall had already observed thatchimpanzees often swallow leaves. They fold them over and swallow them – they don’t chew or digest them – and they poop them out whole. The idea was that those leaves also have chemicals that are bad for worms. But it turned out that they are really rough, like Velcro. Worms get stuck on them. The leaves also irritate the gut, so it purges the gut.It is medicine.</p><p>How did you make your own discovery?</p><p>I was studying monarch butterflies, trying to understand parasite evolution. There is a parasite quite similar to malaria,Ophryocystis elektroscirrha, that infects monarchs. One feature of monarch caterpillars is that they eat only milkweeds, which contain chemicals called cardenolides. They use these plant toxins to make themselves poisonous to predators. I knew about the chimpanzee studies, so I thought, let’s see if milkweeds also have an effect on the parasite. I reared monarchs on different species of milkweeds and found that when the plants were more toxic, the monarchs became less infected and suffered lower parasite burdens and less disease. My thought was: “Wow, maybe these butterflies can actually use this as medication.”</p><p>Animals have evolved all these fascinating ways to deal with infections</p><p>How did that idea go down?</p><p>I think it was easier to accept that chimpanzees can medicate, because we give them credit for intelligence that we don’t give to other animals. When we wrotethe first paperthat showed the milkweeds had a medicinal effect [in 2007], a peer reviewer said there was no way monarchs can do this. So we had to remove it. But that didn’t stop us. We did experiments. We had infected and uninfected caterpillars, and we gave them a choice between medicinal and non-medicinal milkweed. They had no preference. Then we looked at female butterflies. One of the ways the parasite spreads is from mothers to offspring: when the female is infected, she is covered in parasite spores and these get scattered onto the milkweed and the caterpillars eat them. What we found is that infected female butterflies have a strong preference to lay their eggs on the medicinal milkweed. And that helps their offspring. It was a very clear medicinal effect.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Gripping account of how plants and animals shaped each other</p><p></p><p>Monarch butterflies use milkweed as a medicine</p><p>Jaap de Roode</p><p>Did those results convince the sceptics?</p><p>From the late 2000s, a lot of papers started appearing. When woolly bear caterpillars are infected with parasitoid flies, theyincrease their consumption of alkaloids, a type of chemical that kills these flies. Wood antsincorporate tree resin into their nestsand it helps against the growth of microorganisms. For the woolly bear caterpillars, it is self-medication. For the wood ants, it is prophylaxis. So, it was becoming a trend at the time, which helped in the acceptance of our findings.</p><p>Many more examples have since been discovered. Which are your favourites?</p><p>When sheep are infected with worms, they prefer to eat plants that have more tannins in them: sheep normally hate tannins, but tannins kill worms.Once the symptoms go away, they stop.</p><p>There is also fumigation. A lot of animals do this, but I love the birds and the butts story. Researchers at theNational Autonomous University of Mexicoin Mexico City discovered this when they were studying how urbanisation is affecting nest building in house finches. They saw all this white fluff in the nests and they didn’t know what it was. But then, when a nest was wet, one of them realised, “Oh, it smells of smoke. These are cigarette butts.” They also found that when there were more cigarette butts in the nest, there were fewer lice, mites and ticks.</p><p>To demonstrate that these birds do this on purpose, they took nests, removed the lining and put in an artificial one. Then they added live ticks, dead ticks or no ticks. What they found is that the birds that had live ticks in their nest startedcollecting more cigarette butts. It’s not an accidental thing. They are purposefully changing their behaviour in response to a threat. In natural conditions, finches collect all sorts of aromatic plants and put them in their nests. They especially use nicotiana plants, which have the same chemicals as the butts. I think they can smell the chemicals.</p><p></p><p>Tropical birds build nests from fungi that may keep parasites at bay</p><p>Many birds’ nests in tropical rainforests contain rhizomorphs, fungal structures that produce defensive chemicals, which may protect nestlings from parasites</p><p></p><p>What other methods do animals use to stay healthy?</p><p>One of the most intriguing examples is anointing. Cats love catnip. When they are exposed to it, they start rolling around in it. They go into this frenzy and you can tell they’re having a good time. But the question has always been, why do they like it? Research in Japan found that when cats roll on catnip, they coat themselves in achemical that repels mosquitoes.</p><p>House finches are known to fumigate their nests with cigarette butts.</p><p>Shutterstock/Karel Bock</p><p>How do animals know when and how to medicate?</p><p>To some extent, they don’t need to. Cats don’t have to know that they are coating themselves in chemicals. All they need to know is that what they are doing gives them a lot of pleasure.</p><p>The question is, how does it evolve? For a lot of systems, we don’t know. But with the woolly bear caterpillars, the researchers reallydissected what is going on. The caterpillars have four different taste receptors and one of them tastes the alkaloids that kill the parasitoids. When they have an infection, that taste receptor starts firing more rapidly, so they get more nerve impulses going to the brain. Alkaloids suddenly taste really great and they want more of them.</p><p>So, there are some innate mechanisms where physiology tells the animal how to respond. There is also individual learning. A lot of animals taste different things by trial and error, and they can make associations. For example, there is work showing thatgoats pair their experience of symptom relief with the intake of particular plantsor chemicals. And then there is social learning. Chimpanzees learn from each other how to swallow leaves. They can fold them in many different ways before they swallow them anddifferent groups of chimpanzees have adopted different techniques.</p><p>There was apaper last yeardocumenting a wild orangutantreating a facial injury with medicinal leaves. Why don’t you give any examples of wound healing in your book?</p><p>I felt I had to focus on where the evidence is clear. With that orangutan, I would like to see more observations. I would like to see that it actually helps, ideally in experiments, but you cannot do that with orangutans.</p><p></p><p>The grand plan to create a periodic table of all animal intelligence</p><p>Animal minds are extraordinarily diverse, but a new attempt to categorise them aims to reveal the distinct nature of intelligence in everything from dolphins to bees – and even us</p><p></p><p>How can people who live with animals allow them to take advantage of their ability to medicate?</p><p>We have dictated everything for our pets without letting them be their own doctors. I spend a lot of time in parks and people’s response to seeing their dogs’ natural behaviours is always interesting: “Don’t eat the dirt!” “Don’t eat the grass!” When my dogs decide to eat grass, I let them, because their body is telling them to do it. Sometimes they poop it out. Sometimes they throw up. With cats, if you have a yard, or even a balcony, make sure to plant some catnip.</p><p>And what about farm animals?</p><p>Right now, we don’t give them opportunities for natural medication, so we have to give them tons of antibiotics andanthelminticsthat kill worms. By allowing them to eat more varied diets that they can use for medication, we don’t need those. It makes our animals healthier. It also prevents drug resistance from evolving, which is a direct medical benefit to us.</p><p></p><p>How do captive animals really feel, and can we make them happier?</p><p>We are finally figuring out the subtle ways that farm and zoo animals reveal their emotional states, from anxiety to optimism and even joy. The insights are also revealing some surprising ways we can improve their lives</p><p></p><p>The examples in your book were all discovered by accident, so surely there must be many other instances of animal doctors out there?</p><p>I think we are going to find others. For now, it is really only vertebrates and insects. We have ignored worms, sponges, snails, all sorts of things. And octopi: they are really smart. One thing I hope to achieve with this book is to say: “Hey, now that we know that animals do it, let’s do a study to find out what animals use medication – and what we can learn from it.”</p><p>What can we learn?</p><p>People have looked at animals for inspiration for a long time. Healers in Seifu’s community learned from porcupines how to treat diarrhoea. They learned from the elephants that make treatments for upset stomachs. Many Native Americans have medicines that are based on looking at what bears do. Oshá root, which treats infections, is a good example.</p><p>Animals have evolved all these fascinating ways to deal with their infections and their health using all sorts of medicines that they find in nature. We can see what they use their medicines for and we can use that as a way of narrowing down what things we should look at to make our own medicines. There is just so much knowledge out there in the animal kingdom.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>It's not a just a revolutionary and safe vaccine technology – mRNA could help make the best and most expensive drugs in the world affordable for everyone</p><p>ByMichael Le Page</p><p>21 March 2025</p><p>ByMichael Le Page</p><p>Moderna’s covid-19 vaccine uses mRNA technology</p><p>Imago/Alamy</p><p>This week, researchers in the US were told to remove all references to mRNA vaccine technology from their grant applications to the National Institutes of Health. It is thought this move could be a precursor to a halt in US government funding of this kind of biomedical research, which could have a wider chilling effect on research into this promising area.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Why midlife is the perfect time to take control of your future health</p><p></p><p>That would be a massive misstep, for not only are mRNA vaccines proving their worth for treating cancer as well as preventing all kinds of infectious diseases, the technology behind them could lead tobetter and much cheaper treatments for just about any diseaseyou can think of.</p><p>mRNA vaccine technology is already under attack in the US. At the state level, there are numerous proposed anti-mRNA laws, ranging from bans on mRNA covid-19 vaccines to blanket bans on all mRNA vaccines. In Texas alone, there are eight proposed anti-mRNA bills, a spokesperson for mRNA vaccine company Moderna toldNew Scientist.</p><p>Florida is even consideringa ban on mRNA vaccines in food, seemingly in response to unfounded conspiracy theories that the vaccines are being put in food. Given the level of ignorance among politicians these proposed anti-mRNA laws reveal, a federal funding ban seems entirely plausible.</p><p>Such a ban could obviously delay vaccine rollout in any future pandemic, potentially costing many lives. But the promise of this technology goes way beyond vaccines, as important as they are.</p><p>Why? Because the molecules in living things that do all the key stuff are proteins – enzymes, antibodies, many hormones and so on. This is why many of the most effective medicines are proteins, too. There’s insulin, trastuzumab (Herceptin) for some breast cancers, adalimumab (Humira) for immune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and many, many more.</p><p>The problem with proteins is that they are large and complex molecules that can be made only by living cells. Making them on an industrial scale is difficult, which is why protein-based drugs cost a lot more than drugs made of simple molecules, such as aspirin. But there’s a potential shortcut: get our bodies to do the work. The cells in our bodies can make any protein if given the recipe – and the recipes come in the form of mRNA, or messenger RNA, which is much easier and cheaper to manufacture.</p><p>More precisely,mRNAs are copies of the protein-making recipesencoded in the DNA of cells. They are like a photocopy of a recipe that you use until it starts to fall to pieces, and then you make another photocopy. The mRNAs break down after a while and the original recipe book – the genome – never gets changed.</p><p>So, mRNA vaccines don’t alter your DNA – a key myth driving anti-mRNA vaccine sentiment. Many viruses, by contrast, certainly can alter your DNA.</p><p>mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases are recipes for making viral proteins, teaching the body how to recognise them. For targeting cancer, many mRNA vaccines code for mutant proteins found on the surface of an individual’s cancer cells. This is howan experimental mRNA vaccine against pancreatic cancerthat got amazing results in an initial trial works.</p><p>There’s no reason, however, that mRNA “vaccines” have to code only for viral or cancer-related proteins. For instance, cystic fibrosis is caused by abnormalities in a protein called CFTR. Trials ofinhalable mRNAs coding for the normal proteinare now under way.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Restoring the brain’s mitochondria could slow ageing and end dementia</p><p></p><p>In principle,any protein therapy could be delivered in mRNA form, meaning those therapies could be developed faster and manufactured for a fraction of the cost of conventional protein drugs. Yes, a lot more work is required to ensure proteins are produced where they are needed and in the quantities required, but the field is advancing fast.</p><p>“The medical and technological breakthroughs behind Moderna’s mRNA platform allow us to apply the same technology across multiple therapeutic areas, leading to promising advancements,” says the Moderna spokesperson.</p><p>These advances will take a lot longer to arrive if the US turns its back on the field because some politicians fail to understand basic biology. And any delays mean we all lose out, because mRNA-based therapies are going to benefit just about everyone on the planet.

        <p>Chemical analysis suggests the 400-million-year-old fossil Prototaxites was neither plant, animal or fungus – hinting at a mysterious life form that went extinct long ago</p><p>ByJames Woodford</p><p>21 March 2025</p><p>ByJames Woodford</p><p>Prototaxites formed tall structures like tree trunks, shown in this illustration of a landscape from the Silurian Period</p><p>RICHARD JONES/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY</p><p>A bizarre ancient organism previously thought to be a giant fungus may actually belong to an undiscovered branch of the tree of life that mysteriously went extinct.</p><p>Prototaxites,which lived between 420 million and 375 million years ago, was the first giant terrestrial life form to inhabit Earth. It grew trunk-like structures up to 8 metres tall and 1 metre wide.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Oldest rocks on Earth may contain strange and ancient life forms</p><p></p><p>Its fossils were first discovered in 1843 and were initially thought to be the trunks of rotten conifers. Their classification has been a matter of intense debate, but in 2007,Kevin Boyceat Stanford University, California, and his colleagues concluded from the carbon isotopes in the fossilsthat they were a kind of fungus.This chemical evidence suggested thatPrototaxitesobtained carbon from other living organisms, as fungi do, rather than taking carbon dioxide from the air like plants.</p><p>NowCorentin Loronat the University of Edinburgh, UK, and his colleagues have released a preprint paper in which they say thatPrototaxiteswasn’t afungusat all. Even more confounding, it fits nowhere else in the existing lineages of life.</p><p>Their study focuses on one species in the group,Prototaxites taiti,which was found in the Rhynie chert in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.P. taitiwas much smaller than some of the giant species ofPrototaxitesand only grew to a few tens of centimetres in height.</p><p>P. taiti‘s structure was made up of tubes, just like a fungus, but its tubes branch and connect in ways that are different to fungi, Loron and his colleagues report.</p><p>The Rhynie chert fossil site containingP. taitihas also yielded some bona fide fungi, so Loron and his colleagues did a chemical comparison between these fossil fungi and fossilPrototaxites.</p><p>They found that the chemical signature left in the fossils ofPrototaxitesis completely different to the chemical signature left by fungi subject to the same fossilisation processes. This shows thatPrototaxitesdidn’t contain chitin, a fundamental structural component in fungal cell walls, the researchers say. Instead, the chemical components they identified were most similar to the fossilisation products of lignin, a polymer found in woody plant tissue.</p><p>Loron and his colleagues declined to be interviewed byNew Scientistas their research is yet to be peer reviewed. In their paper, they say thePrototaxitesgroup is defined by three main characteristics: the formation of large, multicellular structures of varied tube types, a composition rich in compounds similar to lignin but distinct from plant matter, and they fed on decaying organic material.</p><p>The researchers say these three key distinguishing features ofPrototaxitesare simply not known together in any living lineage. “We suggest that it is best considered a member of a previously undescribed, entirely extinct group of eukaryotes,” they write.</p><p>No one knows whyPrototaxitesbecame extinct, but some scientists have suggested that it was outcompeted by fungi or the rapid explosion of shrubs and trees.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Last common ancestor of all life emerged far earlier than thought</p><p></p><p>“Given the phylogenetic information we have now, there is no good place to putPrototaxitesin the fungal phylogeny,” says Boyce</p><p>He says it was an organism composed of interwoven microscopic filaments that fed on organic matter rather than photosynthesising, as is true of many fungi. “So maybe it is a fungus, but whether a fungus or something else entirely, it represents a novel experiment with complex multicellularity that is now extinct and does not share a multicellular common ancestor with anything alive today.”</p><p>Brett Summerellat the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, says there are “too many unknowns to say it is a unique lineage at this stage”.</p><p>“The assumption that it was likely to be in the fungi was somewhat nebulous, particularly given the nature of the fossils, and seemed somewhat counterintuitive given the relatively massive size,” he says. “The conclusion that it is a completely unknown eukaryote certainly creates an air of mystery and intrigue around it – probably not likely to be solved until more fossils are discovered or new analytical techniques developed.”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>bioRxivDOI: 10.1101/2025.03.14.643340</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>The Odysseus spacecraft made a rough landing on the moon last year, toppling over and rendering much of its equipment unusable, but an onboard NASA radio telescope called ROLSES-1  was able to make some observations</p><p>ByJonathan O’Callaghan</p><p>21 March 2025</p><p>ByJonathan O’Callaghan</p><p>The Odysseus spacecraft as it approached the moon</p><p>Intuitive Machines</p><p>The first successful use of a radio telescope on the moon has kicked off a new era of astronomy that could shed light on the cosmic dark ages – despite a bumpy landing.</p><p>NASA’s ROLSES-1 (Radio wave Observations at the Lunar Surface of the photoElectron Sheath) telescope was mounted on the Odysseus lander, an Intuitive Machines spacecraft that made thefirst ever private lunar landing last year.While Odysseus was the first such spacecraft to survive a landing, ittipped on its side, rendering most of the equipment on board unusable – but the telescope was spared.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>We live in a cosmic void so empty that it breaks the laws of cosmology</p><p></p><p>“This is the first time that radio astronomy has been done from the moon,” saysJoshua Hibbardat the University of Colorado, Boulder, who was part of the team behind ROLSES-1. It consisted of four 2.5-metre-long spring-loaded antennae. Two of the arms accidentally deployed prior to the landing, while the other two were commanded to deploy after the landing.</p><p>That was enough to give the researchers a few hours of observations before Odysseus ran out of power, allowing them to detect radio emissions from Earth and further afield. The observations revealed that, from afar, our planet’s radio signal appears to twinkle because of Earth’s upper atmosphere – something that may also be the case on inhabited alien worlds. “You could use this as a case study when looking for advanced technological life on exoplanets,” says Hibbard.</p><p>ROLSES-1 also detected radio signals from elsewhere in the galaxy, the result of high-energy cosmic rays produced by supernovae, black holes and other phenomena interacting with the Milky Way’s magnetic field. The researchers had also hoped to observe radio waves from activity on the sun and Jupiter, but were unsuccessful, as the lander ran out of power. “We missed a solar burst by like a minute,” says Hibbard. “It was really a pity.”</p><p>While ROLSES-1 is the first successful radio telescope on the moon, China’sChang’e-4 missionin 2019 included a similar instrument, but its observations were inconclusive because of noise from the lander. NASA is now set to send many more radio telescopes to the moon, starting with LuSEE-Lite this year, followed by LuSEE-Night and ROLSES-2 in 2026. There are also ambitions to build amassive radio dish in a crater on the moon.</p><p>The drive to get these instruments to the moon is because telescopes deployed on the lunar far side can observe the universe unhindered by interference from Earth. That might allow astronomers to detect the first evidence of a faint radio signal from the cosmic dark ages, a period less than a million years after the big bang, before the first stars formed.</p><p>“The universe would have been just expanding gas,” saysStuart Baleat the University of California, Berkeley. “If we can resolve this feature, it should tell us something about the energy budget of dark matter before there was any astrophysics at all.”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>arXivDOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2503.09842</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>Spending a lot of time outdoors may be the best way to prevent myopia, or delay its progression, but this isn't always practical. Now, research suggests that bringing the outside in may be a valid workaround</p><p>ByChris Simms</p><p>21 March 2025</p><p>ByChris Simms</p><p>A classroom decorated as part of a myopia trial in Lijiang in Yunnan province, China</p><p>Weizhong Lan/ AIER Academy of Opthalmology, Central South University</p><p>Myopia has long been linked to spending too much time inside, but new research suggests that just simulating the outdoors in classrooms could help ward off the condition in children.</p><p>Short-sightedness, or myopia, generally emerges as the eye changes shape during normal development in early life, and the distance between the cornea at the front of the eye and the retina at the back becomes too long. This results in blurryvisionof distant objects because light coming from them is being focused in front of the retina, rather than on it.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Why we now think the myopia epidemic can be slowed – or even reversed</p><p></p><p>Myopia is becoming more common, especially among children. We aren’t sure why this is, but spendingmore time outsidecan cut the risk. The main hypothesis is that this enables exposure tobright natural light, butanother ideais that the outside world offers more visual stimulation with scenes containing “high spatial frequencies”. This means that there are sudden changes in visual stimuli, such as edges as opposed to mainly smooth, monotonous features, and the thinking is this stimulation may protect against myopia.</p><p>To investigate this idea,Weizhong Lanat Central South University in China and his colleagues created an indoor environment with many high spatial frequencies by decorating a classroom to look like a woodland. This involved covering walls and even desks with images of trees and bushes and making the ceiling resemble the sky.</p><p>Lighting was slightly adjusted in the classrooms to make it consistent between the two groups. “As the walls are less reflective when covered with tree images etc., lights were adjusted so that illuminance on the desks was the same in the two classrooms,” says team memberIan Flitcroftat Children’s Health Ireland at Temple Street Hospital, Dublin.</p><p>For one year, Lan’s team had about 250 children, aged around 9, from 10 classes at a school in Lijiang in Yunnan province take their lessons in a classroom decorated like a woodland, while another group of around 250 children learned in a traditional-looking classroom, painted white.</p><p>Before and after the study, the children were assessed for signs of myopia, according to the curvature of their eye lenses. This is measured in dioptres, with thebeginnings of myopiagenerally defined as -0.50 dioptres.</p><p>After one year, the eyes of long-sightedchildrenin the outdoor-mimicking classroom, those who struggle to focus on things very close to them, had moved towards myopia 0.22 dioptres less than those in the traditional classroom. For children with 20/20 vision, their eye curvature changed 0.18 dioptres less.</p><p>“I think it’s clinically significant,” saysBilly Hammondat the University of Georgia in the US. “If you can’t prevent kids from getting myopia, at least you can reduce the degree of myopia.”</p><p>However, if the students already had myopia, the woodland classrooms made no difference. They probably couldn’t see the high spatial frequencies as well as the other children, so it would have had little effect for them, says Hammond.</p><p>The findings seem to support the idea that spatial frequencies are important to myopia risk. The eye grows according to the stimuli it sees, says Hammond. Environments with artificiallightthat lack high spatial frequencies may result in limited eye development, he says, whereas the outdoors provides a huge range of patterns and changes of colour, distance and brightness, encouraging a workout for the eyes.</p><p></p><p>Why spending time near water gives us a powerful mental health boost</p><p>We have long known that connecting with nature in green spaces is great for our mental health. Now fresh research is showing that time near water – by the coast, rivers and even fountains in the park – is even more restorative</p><p></p><p>Outdoor scenes could be implemented cost-effectively in classrooms and other indoor environments, says Lan. “According to the students, the design did not distract their attention; instead, they felt it enhanced their study efficiency.”</p><p>“The study is a nice first indication,” saysK. Davina Frickat Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. “But I’d want a lot more information before anyone makes a recommendation that everybody should try painting outdoor scenes on the walls of classrooms.” Spending more time outdoors is probably preferable to reduce a child’s myopia risk, and for the other benefits it brings, says Frick.</p><p>Hammond echoes this point. “Painting the walls with murals is not even close to the experience of going outside, but it’s probably better than nothing,” he says.</p><p>Journal reference:</p><p>medRxivDOI: 10.1101/2025.03.10.25323549</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

For one thing, the logistics of making a satellite in Europe and then launching it in Europe – rather than having to ship it halfway around the world – would be simpler and cheaper.</p><p>It would also be simpler to have small, cheap launch vehicles that could put a single satellite into orbit, rather than having to share a ride with several other missions, all of which may want to reach a different height or orbit.</p><p>Then there is the current political situation.

Thanks to the planet’s spin, they start out travelling much faster relative to the centre of Earth than rockets launching near the poles.</p><p>Andøya Space Center is located at 69° north, so Earth’s rotational speed is considerably weaker there than in French Guiana.

This would include sun-synchronous orbits – those that always pass over a given point at the same local time – which are ideal for spy and weather satellites. Isar already has a contract to put Arctic Ocean surveillance satellites into just such an orbit for the Norwegian Space Agency.</p><p>The launch site is also reasonably free of air and marine traffic, and it benefits from all the infrastructure needed for small launch vehicles. “It will be more limited in terms of what you can achieve, but it’s still, I think, reasonable,” says Amato.</p><p>Amato says Isar Aerospace could be following SpaceX away from the traditional space approach of extensive design and cautious testing to a more Silicon Valley “test, fail, improve” strategy. “I would expect failure,” says Amato. “Which is not necessarily bad.”</p><p>“Now, the question is, can you get to a design that survives and that’s reliable before you run out of money?” he says. “That’s the race.

    <h1>A radical new idea for how our ancestors invented stone tools</h1>

        <p>Stone tools are considered the first form of technology devised by ancient humans – but they might not have been invented from scratch</p><p>ByMichael Marshall</p><p>21 March 2025</p><p>ByMichael Marshall</p><p>Natural processes can turn stones like these chert “balls”, found in a field in Oman, into sharp flakes</p><p>Michelle R. Bebber and Metin I. Eren</p><p>When ancient humans first invented stone tools, they may have been trying to emulate naturally formed sharp stones, meaning they would not have needed a huge leap of inspiration.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Can we ever know who invented the wheel?</p><p></p><p>“What our hypothesis does is, it really turns the origin of technology entirely on its head,” saysMetin Erenat Kent State University in Ohio. Instead of imagining a sharp tool and then figuring out how to make it, early hominins may have usednatural sharp edgesfor millennia before anyone tried crafting them. “Rather than hominins creating the knife and then looking for something to cut, we propose that they were already exploiting carcasses,” he says.</p><p>One of the defining features of hominins is their ability to bothmake and use stone tools, which are useful for butchering animals and opening hard fruits. Creating astone toolrequireshitting two rocks togetherin precise ways, knocking flakes off one of them in order to shape it into a cutting edge.</p><p>This is called “knapping”, and hominins have been doing it forat least 2.6 million years. There are even olderstone toolsfrom Lomekwi in Kenya,dating back 3.3 million years, but these were made using a simpler method: bashing a single stone on the ground.</p><p>“It’s been traditionally thought that the very first stone flakes were produced intentionally or by accident, and then early hominins started to look for things to cut with these new sharp implements,” says Eren. He says this story doesn’t make sense. “For a creature to start to use an item, or to invent an item, there has to be a selective pressure first.”</p><p>Eren and his colleagues argue that hominins found naturally sharpstones, which they used as cutting tools. By doing so, they developed a habit of cutting and began seeking out such stones.</p><p>“Mother Nature is producing knives all over the place,” says Eren. He calls these raw blades “naturaliths”.</p><p>The team has compiled multiple examples of naturaliths. Eren has studied stones from Antarctica, which resemble hominin tools but must have been made by natural processes, since no hominin ever lived in Antarctica. Experiments have also shown that tool-like artefacts can be produced when large animals likeelephantsandhorsestrample on stones.Monkeys sometimesaccidentally knock flakes off stones. There are also processes that don’t involve living animals, such as waves crashing on rocky shores, frost fracture and glaciers grinding over bedrock.</p><p>If naturaliths were available in hominins’ habitat, says Eren, it would be easy to start using them. “All they need to do is pick them up.”</p><p>Five fragments of this stone (bottom) were found in Kenya, and two of them feature long axes with sharp edges (top)</p><p>Eren et al.</p><p>For Eren, the appeal of this hypothesis is that it doesn’t require a “eureka moment” of inspiration. “It shortens the cognitive distance between every step in the origin of technology,” he says. He calls it “the most parsimonious proposal” for how hominins invented stone cutting tools.</p><p>However, Eren emphasises that this hypothesis is a suggestion, not a fact. He calls it “a big swing”. While the team has listed examples of naturaliths and processes that could make them, many other tests are needed. Eren wants to look for naturaliths from times and places where hominins lived, and find evidence that they were used as cutting tools. That could include distinctive wear patterns or traces of plant and animal material on the sharp edges. It might also be possible to find naturaliths that hominins have transported over long distances.</p><p>Such evidence might not be forthcoming. “Simply because the hypothesis is parsimonious doesn’t mean it’s correct,” says Eren.</p><p>“I think it’s a really intriguing proposal,” saysBriana Pobinerat the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. “Maybe the invention of stone tools wasn’t this major cognitive leap,” she says, but instead a “natural extension of what hominins were already doing”. She also says that the biggest challenge will be testing the idea, in particular figuring out whether an apparent tool was made by a hominin, an animal or a non-biological process.</p><p></p><p>Monkeys in Thailand took up stone tools when covid-19 stopped tourism</p><p>Long-tailed macaques on the island of Koh Ped appear to have learned a new way to forage when the pandemic put a stop to feeding by tourists</p><p></p><p>Identifying the sources of naturaliths is useful, saysClaudio Tennieat the University of Tübingen in Germany. However, the researchers’ “specific story just doesn’t check out”.</p><p>Tennie says the proposal relies on an assumption: that inventing stone tools from scratch is too cognitively difficult for hominins to have pulled off. “That’s not true,” he says. Instead, several lines of evidence suggest that hominins were smart and creative enough to come up with knapping unaided.</p><p>For instance, in a 1994 study Gregory Westergaard and Stephen Suomi reported thatcaptive capuchin monkeys used stones as cutting toolsand modified the stones by striking them against hard surfaces. If capuchins could make and use stone tools, presumably hominins could too. In a series of studies published in 2022, Tennie’s team showed thatorangutans could make and use stone toolswithout training; thatwild gorillas sometimes bash stone-like objects together, a prerequisite for knapping; and thathumans can figure out basic knappingwithout help.</p><p>“These beings had available certain strategies, certain intelligences,” says Tennie. He thinks hominins didn’t need a helping hand from naturaliths.</p><p>Eren thinks they did. He argues that those experiments may not tell us much about early hominins because several of them used captive primates, and modern humans are not the same as hominins that lived millions of years ago. “Even if hominins were clever enough to spontaneously invent stone tools at will, that does not negate our hypothesis that Mother Nature helped them along,” he says.</p><p>Journal reference:</p><p>ArchaeometryDOI: 10.1111/arcm.13075</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

        <p>Tutankhamun ruled ancient Egypt shortly after a period of religious instability, and objects from his tomb suggest he took advantage to invent new funerary rituals</p><p>ByColin Barras</p><p>21 March 2025</p><p>ByColin Barras</p><p>The inner sarcophagus of King Tutankhamun, who ruled during the 18th dynasty of ancient Egypt</p><p>Buddy Mays / Alamy</p><p>A collection of roughly made clay trays and wooden staffs found among the golden treasures ofTutankhamun’s tombmay offer the earliest evidence of an important ancient Egyptian royal funerary ritual. The idea is the latest indication that the boy king had a burial unlike that of any other pharaoh.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Survival of the friendliest? Why Homo sapiens outlived other humans</p><p></p><p>Tutankhamun’s nine-year-long reign in the 14th century BC came shortly after a period of religious turmoil in ancient Egypt. One of his predecessors – Akhenaten, who was probably Tutankhamun’s father – had abandoned ancient Egypt’s traditional polytheistic faith in favour of a new religion centred on the worship of asingle deity known as Aten.</p><p>Tutankhamun and his advisers played an important role in restoring the older faith. But this also presented them with an opportunity to reinterpret and update some traditional rituals, saysNicholas Brownat Yale University. Evidence for this may lie in the four clay trays, each about 7.5 centimetres by 4.5 centimetres, and four 1.1-metre-tall wooden staffs found in Tutankhamun’s tomb.</p><p>Brown suspects they were used in a funerary ritual known at the Awakening of Osiris, which was first represented in ancient Egyptian artwork several decades after Tutankhamun’s reign. “I’m pretty convinced that what we’re seeing within Tutankhamun’s burial chamber is probably the earliest iteration of this ritual that we can see in the archaeological record,” says Brown.</p><p>The trays and staffs were placed on reed matting just 1.5 metres from the head of Tutankhamun’s sarcophagus. Brown says this invites comparison with the later artwork showing the Awakening of Osiris ritual.</p><p>In this artwork, the pharaoh – who in death has become Osiris, the god of the underworld – is commanded to wake by staffs held behind his head. Brown says the clay trays were a crucial component of this ritual too because they would have held libations – perhaps in the form of water from the Nile – that were believed to help revive the decomposing body. Such libations were often placed on reed matting so that their symbolic purity was untainted by the impure ground. Even the fact that the clay vessels were crudely made from Nile mud is important, he says, because Osiris was also symbolised by the fertile Nile soil.</p><p>Jacobus van Dijkat the University of Groningen in the Netherlands agrees that the clay trays may have had a ritualistic purpose – although in a forthcoming article he argues they may have been used in a different ritual known as the “spell of the four torches” that predates Tutankhamun’s rule. In this ritual, four torch-bearing guides stand near the sarcophagus and help the dead pharaoh journey through the underworld, before each extinguishes his torch in a clay tray filled with milk from a white cow.</p><p>Two of the three complete mud trays from Tutankhamun’s tomb</p><p>Metropolitan Museum of Art</p><p>“I definitely think that’s a good interpretation too,” says Brown. He adds that the ancient Egyptians often used the same objects in several different ways, so the clay trays could have been used in both rituals.</p><p>“It’s quite possible that what we see in Tutankhamun’s burial is a precursor to the Awakening of Osiris ritual,” saysSalima Ikramat the American University in Cairo, Egypt.</p><p>About 10 years ago, Ikram argued that there isplenty of other evidence of innovation in Tutankhamun’s burial. For instance, many aspects of his embalming process were highly unusual, and the boy king may be the only pharaoh whose penis was mummified in an erect position – another symbol of Osiris and his regenerative potential. Ikram speculates that the ancient Egyptians went the extra mile to showcase the links between the dead pharaoh and Osiris to emphasise his legitimacy as well as the legitimacy of traditional religious beliefs and practices. “The burial certainly firmly linked Tutankhamun to the kings from the earlier part of the 18th dynasty, separating him from Akhenaten,” says Ikram.</p><p>Journal reference:</p><p>Journal of Egyptian ArchaeologyDOI: 10.1177/03075133251322798</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

    <h1>Why you should slow down your brain’s ageing – and how to do it</h1>

        <p>Many of us have a brain that is older than our years. But there are plenty of things you can do to counteract this, says neuroscience columnist Helen Thomson</p><p>ByHelen Thomson</p><p>21 March 2025</p><p>ByHelen Thomson</p><p>MRI scans can reveal how a brain is ageing</p><p>Dennis Hallinan / Alamy Stock Photo</p><p>Lately, my brain has felt decidedly ancient. I’m only in my 40s, but last week I completely blanked on the date of my wedding anniversary, forgot the name of a friend’s son and couldn’t seem to concentrate on any work.</p><p>So when I was asked to write a column forNew Scientistall about the brain, one question immediately came to mind: how old is mine? Years of research show that organs such as ourheart, kidneys and ovaries don’t all age at the same pace– and now we know that some people’s brains also age faster than others. Not only that, we can test this pace of ageing and even slow it down.</p><p></p><p>Read more</p><p>Why midlife is the perfect time to take control of your future health</p><p></p><p>One way to identify your brain’s age is simply by taking a picture. MRI scans show how, from around the age of 30, our brains start to shrink due to the atrophy of cells and their connections. Using thousands of these images, researchers can identify deviations that indicate whether your brain is ageing slower or faster than expected.</p><p>Genetic tests offer an another insight – new research shows howseven gene variants in particularhave a particularly strong effect on accelerated brain ageing. Proteins, which are made by genes, also play a role.One large studyanalysed levels of specific proteins to calculate whether participants’ organs matched their real age. It found that 1 in 5 people had an organ with a strongly accelerated age and that those with an accelerated brain age were at an increased risk of dementia.</p><p>Research has also revealed that brains can age in different ways. WhenChristos Davatzikosat the University of Pennsylvania and his colleaguesanalysed brain scans from almost 50,000 people, they found five distinct patterns of brain ageing. They linked various age-related diseases to combinations of the five patterns. Interestingly, the team found that certain lifestyle factors were associated with whether a person’s brain atrophy followed a particular combination – smoking, drinking alcohol and eating a diet high in cheese, coffee or salt was associated with patterns that were linked to dementia, for instance, whereas people who drank tea and ate cereals were less likely to have brains that followed these patterns.</p><p>These correlations add to growing evidence that we can influence the age of our brains. It’s even been suggested that40 per cent of dementia cases could be prevented or delayedby lifestyle choices.</p><p>For that reason, you might want to find out your own brain age – and make some changes. One company established with this in mind is NeuroAge Therapeutics, founded by physician and neuroscientistChristin Glorioso. NeuroAge uses MRI scans to identify structural brain changes and white matter hyperintensities – damaged areas of tissue that increase your risk of stroke and dementia – combining them with the results of blood tests, genetic tests and cognitive games.</p><p>Glorioso’s interest in brain ageing was triggered by discovering she possessed a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease. Like as many as 1 in 4 people, she has an increased risk of Alzheimer’s because she possesses one copy of the APOE4 variant of the APOE gene. However, she and her colleagues’ research has shown how havinga brain age five years younger than your actual age can offset the impact of this variant.</p><p></p><p>The shocking discovery that our gut microbiome drives ageing</p><p>A new understanding of our relationship with our "friendly" gut microbes shows they actually have a dark side and help cause ageing. Here's how to fight back</p><p></p><p>Glorioso started the company so that people like her could determine the age of their brain and make changes that help overcome such genetic predispositions. “One of the coolest things is seeing white matter hyperintensities disappearing as you make lifestyle changes over the years,” she says. “You can see your brain ageing slower than you’re ageing.”</p><p>There’s one catch: at $3194 for the full package, it’s too expensive for most. It is difficult to find out the age of your brain from home or for free, but cognitive games can give you a rough idea. Neuro Therapeutics offers a broad estimate of brain age based on how your performance fares against others your age. But they have their limitations, which Glorioso acknowledges. My brain turned out to be a sprightly 21 years younger than my actual age, but that was certainly more a reflection of my love of the memory tricks that helped me complete the tasks, rather than a true measure of a youthful brain.</p><p>Even without knowing your exact brain age, there are plenty of ways to ensure it stays younger for longer. Clinical trials have shown how those seven key gene variants associated with brain ageing can be targeted and their effects minimised by common supplements and diet choices, such as ensuring you have adequate vitamin D and eat enoughomega-3 fatty acids. Among other things,vitamin D plays an essential role in maintaining the health of brain cellsin pathways associated with memory and depression.Omega-3 fatty acids, meanwhile, have an anti-inflammatory effectin the brain and help mop up unwanted substances, such as the beta-amyloid peptides associated with Alzheimer’s.</p><p>Building evidence also shows howlearning new skills,speaking multiple languagesand maintaining a rich social life can improve your cognitive reserve, a measure of your brain’s resilience against damage. When tempted not to attend a social gathering where I might not know many people, I always remember what neuroscientistEllen Bialystokat York University in Toronto once told me: “What’s hard for your brain is good for your brain.”</p><p></p><p>We may finally know how cognitive reserve protects against Alzheimer's</p><p>Why does mental effort lead to a more resilient brain that can withstand dementia and decline? We are now discovering the mechanisms behind this cognitive reserve, opening up new ways to boost it</p><p></p><p>It’s also worth checking out the latestLancetcommission on brain ageing, which identifies14 lifestyle risk factorsfor brains that age faster than they should.Smokingis one well-established factor, as is drinking – evenlow-level alcohol consumption is associated with premature brain ageing.</p><p>When it comes to diet, things are a little trickier: theLancetreport didn’t suggest any foods that were good or bad for brain ageing because evidence tends to be so mixed. However, aMediterranean dietis probably a good place to start – ameta-analysis in Januaryconcluded that it was associated with an 11 to 30 per cent lower risk of cognitive conditions.</p><p>There is one particularly simple intervention, though.Uncorrected visionhas been linked with faster brain ageing, although scientists aren’t sure why. The evidence is strong enough to convince me to book an immediate eye examination – an easy step that might not help with remembering an imminent wedding anniversary, but will keep my brain looking (and feeling) younger for longer.</p><p></p><p>Why we now think the myopia epidemic can be slowed – or even reversed</p><p>Rates of near-sightedness are rising all over the world. But solutions to the epidemic are coming into focus and could be simpler than you think</p><p></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Receive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox! </p><p>            We'll also keep you up to date withNew Scientistevents and special offers.</p>

American Oversight complained that the discussion in the Signal chat amounted to policy deliberations that needed to be retained.</p><p>During a brief federal court hearing before Boasberg in Washington, the Trump administration said the agencies led by the officials in the Signal chat were already taking steps to preserve what they each had. However, it was not immediately known what each agency had individually retained.</p><p>In one court filing, the administration’s lawyers at the justice department said one of the participants in the Signal chat, Bessent, had already turned over the version of messages that was on his phone. It also said the defense department had requested a full copy of the chat from Hegseth’s phone.</p><p>Separately, the White House instructed this week that the so-called “department of government efficiency” preserve all communications sent over the Signal app in a new “records retention policy”, according to a court filing in an unrelated case, but seemingly in response to the fallout from the Houthi attack group chat.</p>

        <p>Esther Ghey’s grief for her murdered daughter is so raw that her participation here is agony to watch. Sadly, the important thing in TV is to be first</p><p>It is possible to make a cynical piece of television without anyone who appears on screen having a drop of toxicity in their veins. Documentaries with subjects ripped from the headlines are particularly likely candidates; documentaries centring the recently, appallingly bereaved even more so.</p><p>We turn, then, to Brianna: A Mother’s Story. Brianna is Brianna Ghey, the 16-year-old who in 2023 wasmurdered in a premeditated attackby two 15-year‑olds – Scarlett Jenkinson, whom Brianna considered a friend, and Jenkinson’s friend (if that is the correct word for what seems more accurately to have been a murderous partnership between two disturbed individuals) Eddie Ratcliffe. They lured Brianna to a park, then stabbed her 28 times. Det Supt Adam Waller of Cheshire police says he still wrestles with “the level of depravity” on display in the attack. Brianna’s friends, still in their teens, remember that “she was kind, funny, could always make you feel better” and how “she brought me comfort”. They share videos full of giddy, youthful energy and laughter.</p><p>The mother is Esther Ghey, who now campaigns for online protections for young people and better mental health support in schools. Brianna had transferred to a new school in February 2020 after being bullied. According to the headteacher, Emma Mills, Brianna was keen to make “a fresh start”.</p><p>Then came lockdown. Esther describes Brianna retreating into an online world – using several accounts, so Esther could never quite be sure what was going on – and talking to people and accessing material that made Esther “afraid I was going to find her and Alicia [Brianna’s sister] raped and murdered”. Then Brianna “started growing her hair and came out as trans just before going back to school”.</p><p>Esther’s grief is still so raw – she has not reached the stage where she can talk about Brianna without crying – that it makes you wish there was someone campaigning for greater television regulation, too. It should be forbidden to film someone when they are clearly still in the throes of the most awful misery. Clearly, though, the decision to take part was Esther’s – and she felt able to do so, as she did when she gavean in-depth interviewto the Guardian in February.</p><p>But the important thing in television is to be first. And the rawer the pain, the better it plays, in production terms. So what we get is that on parade. Anything that could add depth or meaning, or allow us to learn or draw conclusions, is not included.</p><p>We do not learn what or whom Brianna was exposed to online. The coverage of the court case is minimal. We learn that Jenkinson was obsessed with torture videos and are left with the impression that Ratcliffe was more of a follower than a leader (although it was his clothes that were covered in Brianna’s blood and his house in which the murder weapon was found), but no proper parsing of their roles is undertaken. Ratcliffe’s anti-transgender messages are quoted and there is footage of the judge citing hatred of trans people as a secondary motivation, but it is not made clear that this was attributed to Ratcliffe only. Jenkinson seems to have been fixated on Brianna and said after her conviction that she tried to kill her (at first by poisoning her with painkillers in a McDonald’s milkshake) because she was afraid her friend was going to leave her.</p><p>Knowing how to weight and sort the parts played by the various issues is impossible. There is a powerful interview with a former senior engineer at Meta,Arturo Béjar, who resigned when his warnings about the harm being done by the algorithms serving up ever darker content to curious children and teens were ignored. He says that, with the will to do so, feeds could be appropriately circumscribed by companies “within a year”. But his segment is brief and there is no time given to how this will can be inculcated, nor to looking at governments’ unwillingness to regulate the internet for the public good.</p><p>In short, there is nothing that makes this documentary worthwhile, or that makes it feel like anything but an exploitation of a family’s unutterable sadness. The best that can be hoped is that it is so anodyne that there is no backlash that hurts these suffering people further.</p><p>Brianna: A Mother’s Story aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now</p>

        <p></p><p>Sonia Bompastor channelled compatriot Édith Piaf, saying she wanted her players “to have no regrets” come the final whistle of their Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City, and three first-half goals and a relentless performance overturned the two-goal deficit from the first leg.</p><p>We have been waiting for Chelsea to move into fifth gear, for a display across 90 minutes reflective of their dominance in all competitions and the talent in the squad, and here Bompastor’s side delivered the gear change when it mattered most. Goals from Sandy Baltimore, Nathalie Björn and Mayra Ramírez saw off City in style to set up a mouthwatering semi-final against the Champions League holders, Barcelona, who earlierdispatched Wolfsburg 10-2 on aggregate.</p><p>The Chelsea manager made five changes to the team that scored astoppage-time winnerat the Etihad Stadium on Sunday and it was this ability to freshen up her team that many predicted would make the difference. Sure enough the Blues were able to maintain an intensity that a depleted and limited City squad could not match.</p><p>Much has been made of City’s injury crisis, with Khadija Shaw, Aoba Fujino, Rebecca Knaak, Lauren Hemp, Alex Greenwood, Laura Blindkilde Brown and Ayaka Yamashita all out and only five players named on the bench for the trip to Stamford Bridge.</p><p>However, the home team also had absentees; Naomi Girma, Sam Kerr, Guro Reiten, Maelys Mpomé, Kadeisha Buchanan and Sophie Ingle all injured and Zecira Musovic pregnant.</p><p>Such is the quality and number of players available to Chelsea it is easy to forget who is not there and overlook the work done to ensure they remain competitive. City’s injuries are a valid excuse for failure on the pitch but they are not an excuse for a club that should be investing more in its playing group.</p><p>There was a frenetic energy to Chelsea from the off as a result of the fresh legs, a fire in the bellies and belief emanating from the players. Bompastor stood in a power stance in her technical area, living every pass and every run, one step away from racing on to the pitch to do the job herself.</p><p>Their pressure was relentless and although the crowd was half the size of that which graced theEmirates Stadium a night earlier, the 10,769 fans absorbed the fight of the players in blue and fed back with the same intensity. Goals were coming and they were only going one way, the contrast between the game in London and the phenomenal and battling City performanceeight days priorwas stark. It took 14 minutes for Chelsea to capitalise on their dominance, a relentless Lucy Bronze driving into the box from the right and launching a shot off the post that Baltimore was there to follow up on, blasting into the corner from the left.</p><p>City regrouped, somewhat, in the immediate aftermath of the goal, Mary Fowler and Kerolin forcing straightforward saves from Hannah Hampton, and then the Chelsea show resumed. They were level on 37 minutes and ahead just before the break for the first time in the tie.</p><p>First, Baltimore’s corner was met by Björn, who sent a looping header past Khiara Keating, the Chelsea duo returned to the starting XI for this fixture, then Lauren James escaped on the right before pulling the ball back for Ramírez to turn in. The visiting team looked shell-shocked, unable to cope with or adapt to the terrier-like pressure of their opponents.</p><p>Sign up toMoving the Goalposts</p><p>No topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s football</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>It would be unfair to say Chelsea’s energy dipped in the second half, but there was a slightly more patient and pragmatic approach once they had the lead. They were still the more potent side, Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and Erin Cuthbert forcing saves from Keating minutes apart just after the hour.</p><p>Cuthbert would go closest in the second half, another effort coming back off the bar earning a collected gasp of disappointment from the crowd that had chanted “we want four” at half-time.</p><p>City tried to muster some sort of challenge, the one-goal margin providing some hope for Nick Cushing’s team, but it left them exposed at the back and Chelsea were a constant threat on the break.</p><p>Bompastor’s side have emerged from the four back-to-back games against City with three wins and one defeat – that one defeat, in the first leg, the game they could afford to lose. They march on with a first trophy under their belts, the League Cup, and, arguably, their best form ahead of them.</p>

        <p>Albanese visits governor general to kickstart five-week election campaign, with polls suggesting Labor is in a tight contest with Coalition under Peter Dutton</p><p>Anthony Albanese has framed the federal election as a choice between Labor’s plan to “keep building” and Peter Dutton’s “promises to cut” after announcing voters will head to the polls on 3 May.</p><p>The prime minister visited the governor general, Sam Mostyn, on Friday morning to dissolve the 47th parliament, triggering a five-week race to form the next government.</p><p>Announcing the election date at Parliament House, Albanese later cast Labor as best placed to steer Australia through “uncertain times”.</p><p>At one point brandishing a Medicare card, the prime minister cited the government’s support for bulk billing, cutting student debts and tax cuts announced in Tuesday’s budget as centrepieces of the campaign.</p><p>Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</p><p>Albanese said the world had “thrown a lot at Australia” over the past three years but the government had chosen to face global challenges “the Australian way – helping people under cost-of-living pressure, while building for the future”, and the economy was now turning the corner.</p><p>Nodding to the shadow of Donald Trump’s administration hanging over the campaign, Albanese said the biggest risk to Australia’s economy was “not what’s happening elsewhere in the world”.</p><p>“The biggest risk to Australia’s future is going back to the failures of the past, the tax increases and cuts to services thatPeter Duttonand the Liberal party want to lock in,” he said.</p><p>Albanese is aiming to become the first prime minister since John Howard in 1998 to win a second term.</p><p>Making the case for a second term, Albanese said that “it was always going to take more than three years to clean up 10 years of mess” left by previousCoalitiongovernments.</p><p>“The world today is an uncertain place but I am absolutely certain of this – now is not the time for cutting and wrecking, for aiming low, punching down or looking back,” Albanese said. “This is a time for building – building on our nation’s strengths, building our security and prosperity for ourselves, building an Australia where no one is held back and no one is left behind.”</p><p>Albanese passionately attackedDutton’s plan to sack 41,000 public servants, citing the example of public servants he met in Hervey Bay helping residents affected by the Queensland floods “working out of a caravan to make sure that those Australians got the money they were entitled to and deserved”.</p><p>“They’re gone under Peter Dutton.”</p><p>Albanese denied he would be running a scare campaign against Dutton for five weeks until election day.</p><p>“What I want is a campaign about policy substance and about hope and optimism for our country. I’m optimistic about Australia. That’s one of the big distinctions in this campaign,” the prime minister said.</p><p>Labor holds 78 seats in the lower house – a two-seat majority – and Albanese is adamant the government can be returned in its own right despite most opinion polls pointing to ahung parliament.</p><p>Asked about potential power-sharing deals with the crossbench, the prime minister said he intended to form a majority government and would serve a full term if re-elected.</p><p>Dutton is hoping to lead the Coalition back to power just three years after its thumping2022 election defeat, when Scott Morrison’s government lost 19 seats, including six heartland electorates to teal independents.</p><p>The opposition leader has pitched a12-point planto “get Australia back on track”, which features his proposal to replace coal-fired power stations with nuclear reactors, cut immigration to free-up housing and slash “wasteful”government spending, including in the public service.</p><p>In his budget reply speech on Thursday, Dutton alsopledged to halve the fuel excise for 12 months and increase gas supply to reduce prices.</p><p>Dutton has also targeted Albanese’s character, painting the prime minister as “weak” on issues ranging from antisemitism to standing up to Xi Jinping.</p><p>In a campaign video launched on Friday morning, Dutton said Australia was at a “turning point” after three years under Albanese.</p><p>“Too many are having to make sacrifices just to afford the weekly shop and pay their bills,” he said. “This election is a choice about who can help Australians get ahead by managing the economy better.”</p><p>The opposition holds 54 seats, meaning it has a mountain to climb to win a majority in the 150-seat House of Representatives.</p><p>Coalition strategists believe Labor is vulnerable in a swag of outer suburban seats, in particular in Sydney and Melbourne, where households have suffered under high interest rates and soaring prices.</p><p>The opposition will need to gain ground in every state but particularly has its eyes on Victoria, where it hopes to take advantage of an unpopular state government, and the outer suburbs and regional seats in New South Wales. Its hopes in Western Australia, where the Liberals lost four seats in 2022 as a“red wave”swept through the west, have been dampened somewhat by afeeble showing in last month’s state election.</p><p>Labor MPs and strategists are confident the government has regained momentum over the past month after several major policy announcements – including an $8.5bn boost to Medicare – andintensifying scrutiny on Duttonand his policies.</p><p>The government has seized on Dutton’s promise to overturn Labor’s new income tax cuts, arguing it meant workers would pay more under the Coalition.</p><p>The Greens andteal independentsare aiming to retain the seats won in 2022, putting them in the frame to act as potential kingmakers in a hung parliament.</p><p>The Greens leader, Adam Bandt,remains optimisticthe party can gain ground despite a string of poor results at recent state, territory and council elections.</p>

        <p>Charles back at Clarence House after ‘temporary side-effects’, with Friday engagements postponed, Palace says</p><p>King Charles required hospital observation on Thursday after experiencing “temporary side-effects” as part of his continuing medical treatment for cancer, Buckingham Palace has said.</p><p>The 76-year-old monarch underwent scheduled treatment for cancer on Thursday morning, which required “a short period of observation in hospital”, according to a palace statement.</p><p>“His majesty’s afternoon engagements were therefore postponed,” a spokesperson said.</p><p>“His majesty has now returned to Clarence House and as a precautionary measure, acting on medical advice, tomorrow’s diary programme will also be rescheduled.”</p><p>The king sent his apologies to “all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed” as a result of his decision to postpone his engagements and reschedule his diary, the statement added.</p><p>A source described it as a “most minor bump in a road that is very much heading in the right direction”.</p><p>Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancerin February 2024 and returned to public-facing duties in April while still undergoing weekly treatment.</p><p>He has had a busy week of engagements, including a reception for media and a visit to a soil exhibition, and he is due to make a historic state visit to Italy in 10 days’ time. It is understood that this visit, where the king plans to become the first British sovereign to address both houses of the Italian parliament, is expected to go ahead as planned.</p><p>The king had been due to meet ambassadors in audiences at Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon and to travel to Birmingham on Friday, but these were postponed.</p><p>The king visited the London Clinic, the same hospital where he was treated for an enlarged prostate in January 2024, on Thursday morning.</p><p>It is understood the side-effects, the specifics of which have not been disclosed, were temporary and not uncommon with many medical treatments.</p><p>He was not joined by the queen during his brief stay, and travelled to and from the hospital by car.</p><p>After he returned home to Clarence House, the king was said to be on good form, and was reported to be working on state papers and making calls from his study.</p><p>A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “His majesty was due to receive credentials from the ambassadors of three different nations this afternoon.</p><p>“Tomorrow he was due to undertake four public engagements in Birmingham, and is greatly disappointed to be missing them on this occasion.</p><p>“He very much hopes that they can [be] rescheduled in due course and offers his deepest apologies to all those who had worked so hard to make the planned visit possible.”</p><p>The announcement from the palace was made late on Thursday evening because the king needed time to consult his staff and medical team after he returned to Clarence House.</p><p>Since his diagnosis last year, the king’s diary of engagements is understood to have been developed in full consultation with his medical team at all stages to protect his recovery.</p><p>It was decided on balance that it was wiser to cancel the visit to Birmingham, which involved four back-to-back engagements, as a precautionary measure.</p><p>Sources told PA Media the hospital visit was not a major development and no further updates were expected on the king’s health, with any minor alterations to his diary that may be required next week being announced in due course.</p><p>Charles became king on 8 September 2022after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>When announcing his cancer diagnosis last February, the palace asked for privacy and only confirmed it was a “form of cancer”.</p><p>The king was diagnosed after a “separate issue of concern was noted” and investigated while he was being treated for a benign prostate condition.</p><p>In December 2024,the palace said the king’s “treatment has been moving in a positive directionand as a managed condition the treatment cycle will continue into next year”.</p><p>When asked how he was that month during a visit with the queen to Walthamstow in north-east London, the king smiled as he replied: “I’m still alive.”</p>

        <p>EPA sets up email address where ‘regulated community’ can request exemption to evade air pollution rules</p><p>Donald Trump’s administration has offered fossil fuel companies an extraordinary opportunity to evade air pollution rules by simply emailing the US president to ask him to exempt them.</p><p>Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)has set up a new email addresswhere what it calls the “regulated community” can request a presidential exemption from their requirements under theClean Air Act, which is used to regulate dangerous toxins emitted from polluting sources.</p><p>Operators of power plants that burn coal or oil, linkedto tens of thousandsof deaths each year in the US via the mercury, arsenic and other carcinogens emitted through their air pollution, have until Monday to ask Trump to allow them to bypass clean air laws.</p><p>“The president will make a decision on the merits” of each request, which can be for up to two years and be renewed, according to the EPA website. Helpfully, the EPA’s site provides a template for these requests, including pointers as to how to successfully ask for an exemption.</p><p>Trump pledged as a presidential candidate to repeal environmental lawsif he got $1bn in campaign donationsfrom oil and gas companies. While he didn’t reach that figure, Trumpdid receive tens of millions of dollars from the industryand has said that the US needs to “drill, baby, drill” through unfettered fossil fuel expansion, rejecting the scientific consensus that burning coal, oil and gas is causing a worsening climate crisis.</p><p>As president, Trump has set about dismantling pollution rules. Dozens of rollbacks by the EPA have targeted regulations that wereintended to save nearly 200,000 lives in the US by 2050, as well as prevent millions of asthma attacks, heart and respiratory problems and other public health harms.</p><p>Rewriting these rules will take time, however, meaning that Trump has turned to an obscure and rarely used corner of the Clean Air Act to suspend pollution rules in the meantime. Under the act, presidents can exempt a business from pollution requirements if the technology necessary to meet the standard is not available and that this is in the US’s national security interests.</p><p>Environmental groups said that power plants had used technology to lower pollutants for years and that the new emailed exemption was an outrageous attempt to side-step clean air laws. “These safeguards protect the health and wellbeing of our communities and there is no legitimate basis to suspend them,” said Laurie Williams, director of the Sierra Club’s beyond coal campaign.</p><p>“The EPA must abandon this ridiculous proposal now, and do its job of holding fossil fuel companies to current air pollution standards.”</p><p>The decision to set up the email by Lee Zeldin, administrator of the EPA, was “an extreme and improper abuse of Clean Air Act authorities that only allow for exemptions from vital pollution protections in very narrow circumstances,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the green advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund.</p><p>Sign up toDown to Earth</p><p>The planet's most important stories.

The group has pledged to “go to court if necessary” to obtain the records, and to make them public.</p><p>“[T]he American public deserves to know what the Trump EPA and polluters are doing to the air they breathe,” said Patton.</p><p>Reached for comment, an EPA spokesperson said: “Section 112(i)(4) specifically states that the president may exempt any stationary source ‘if the president determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so’.”</p>

    <h1>University of Sussex taking legal action over £585,000 free speech fine</h1>

        <p>Vice-chancellor Sasha Roseneil accuses Office for Students of seeking to ‘persecute’ rather than solve problems</p><p>TheUniversity of Sussexis taking legal action to overturn a record fine levied by England’s higher education regulator, accusing the regulator of seeking to “persecute” it rather than solve problems.</p><p>This week the Office for Students (OfS) said itwould fine Sussex £585,000for two “historic” breaches of its regulations related to freedom of speech and governance. It comes after a three-and-a-half-year investigation into theresignation of Prof Kathleen Stock, who was the target of protests at Sussex over her views on gender identification and transgender rights.</p><p>The university intends to challenge the size of the fine – 15 times larger than any previous penalty levied by the OfS – through tribunal, and also seek a judicial review of the judgment.</p><p>Sasha Roseneil, who joined as vice-chancellor a year after the investigation began, said she was initially shocked by the OfS’s judgment but was confident the courts would find in the university’s favour.</p><p>“I think our position is extremely strong, and I think they will lose a judicial review. But I’m not surprised that they’ve dug in, because [the OfS] has been so determined to pursue this, and so unwilling to engage,” Roseneil said in an interview with the Guardian.</p><p>Roseneil said Sussex had substantially overturned sections of the OfS’s interim judgment, delivered last year, which would have fined the university £1m for a string of additional allegations.</p><p>She said: “The provisional decision was much, much worse, and we rebutted it at length. We sent back a 2,000-page response, and they have reduced the fine from the provisional decision – a million-pound fine – to £585,000 and they’ve dropped quite a lot of what they were alleging against us.</p><p>“They haven’t explained why they’ve dropped any of it but one has to imagine they realised that they weren’t on strong legal grounds, and we produced a lot of evidence against what they were saying, including evidence against what they’re still saying.”</p><p>An OfS spokesperson said: “We are confident in the decisions made in this case and will vigorously defend any legal action.”</p><p>Roseneil said the OfS refused to meet the leadership team at Sussex or interview those involved, with the exception of Stock, and instead relied on thousands of pages it requested from the university. She said that when she arrived at Sussex in 2022 she sought a meeting with OfS executives to discuss the investigation but was turned down.</p><p>Arif Ahmed, the OfS’s director for freedom of speech and academic freedom, defended the regulator’s methods. He said: “There may have been occasions where [Sussex] wanted to see somebody, and in fact that was done in writing instead, I’m quite sure that could well have happened. But the engagement would nevertheless have happened in the sense that we communicated with them and they communicated with us.”</p><p>But Roseneil said the OfS had refused to tell Sussex if its amended policies had met its conditions. She said: “We have been up for working with the OfS on these difficult issues but they have just wanted to prosecute us, even persecute us, on this. It’s a very sorry state for a regulator to be doing this rather than actually trying to help the sector work better.”</p><p>The OfS’s final ruling focuses on a trans and non-binary equality policy statement passed in 2018, which the regulator argued had “a chilling effect” that could result in self-censorship by staff and students.</p><p>Sign up toFirst Edition</p><p>Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>Stock,in her response, said the “most egregious” part of the statement was a clause that said “any materials within relevant courses and modules will positively represent trans people and trans lives”. She said she “tried to raise the matter with superiors but to no avail”, and added: “Over time, my teaching about sex and gender in feminist philosophy grew increasingly cautious, and most of my criticism of the sudden sanctification of gender identity took place elsewhere.”</p><p>Roseneil said: “Obviously she left long before I arrived but it is deeply regrettable that Kathleen [Stock] wasn’t supported to the extent that she felt able to stay working at Sussex. I regret that.”</p><p>But she said the OfS had erred by inflating the statement into a “governing document” of the university. “The whole case rests on it being a governing document. This is a really small statement, of which we have many dozens, if not hundreds, of similar policies and statements. Whereas the governing documents of the university are its charter and statutes and regulations. So that’s the core of the problem.”</p><p>Roseneil said the OfS policy was a “sort of libertarian, free speech absolutism” that meant universities were unable to apply rules for anything other than unlawful behaviour or speech.</p><p>“We can’t now say that we will remove or take down antisemitic or anti-Muslim propaganda because not all such propaganda is illegal,” she said.</p>

By early 2020, Saunderson was using an EncroChat-encrypted mobile phone, used by serious organised criminals to send messages and secretly communicate, the court heard.</p><p>Detectives found Saunderson’s DNA on items – size 10 Hugo Boss flip-flops and a toothbrush – at Pegg’s home in Orrell, a suburb of Wigan. Law enforcement agencies also discovered messages on Saunderson’s phone that revealed the “ongoing nature” of his relationship with Pegg, it is alleged.</p><p>Both he and Pegg used burner phones to keep in touch, and there were 80 calls and texts from his phone to hers in the space of a month, the court heard. The only other numbers dialled on Saunderson’s phone were to “prostitutes and escorts”, retired detective constable Kevin Byrne, of the National Crime Agency, told the court.</p><p>He added that in February 2021, Pegg was arrested at her home and this was coordinated, with North Wales police and Merseyside police, with arrests of what he said was the drug gang led by Saunderson.</p><p>The trial continues.</p>

        <p>Migrant dinghy was also confused with vessel from which 35 people were rescued, so incident was marked ‘resolved’</p><p>Survivors and bereaved relatives have told an inquiry into the biggest ever loss of life in a migrant dinghy in the Channel that they believe stereotyping them as “foreigners” contributed to the failure to rescue them before the majority died.</p><p>TheCranston inquiryintohow at least 27 people drowned on 24 November 2021heard that survivors believed many on board could have been saved if rescue had been sent more quickly.</p><p>The four-week inquiry, which concluded its evidence on Thursday, heard that the boat, referred to as “incident Charlie”, thought to be carrying 33 people, including 13 women and eight children, was “wholly unsuitable”. Along with the 27 confirmed dead, four people are still missing. Two survived.</p><p>At least 130 more migrants have lost their lives in the Channel since the November 2021 incident, according to the UN’sInternational Organization for Migration, but incident Charlie remains the largest single loss of life since small boat crossings of the Channel began in 2018.</p><p>The inquiry has heard a litany of failings, including poor communication and understaffing at the Dover coastguard on the night, and a failure of Home Office intelligence sharing.</p><p>Charlie was confused by authorities with another dinghy named “incident Lima”, from which 35 people were successfully rescued, meaning that efforts to continue searching for Charlie passengers were halted. The incident was mistakenly marked as “resolved” and nobody came to their rescue.</p><p>On Wednesday and Thursday the inquiry heard impact statements from bereaved relatives who spoke about their grief and sense of deep loss, compounded by uncertainty in the early days about whether or not their relatives had survived.</p><p>Some said they wished they had died at the same time as their loved ones instead of living in pain, and many said they were struggling to keep going without the people they had lost.

It is estimated that the passengers went into the water at 3.12am or 3.13am.</p><p>In concluding remarks on Thursday, Sonali Naik KC, representing bereaved families and one of the survivors, said: “The tragedy of 24 November was preventable and it should never have happened.

    <h1>Why Trump’s 25% tariffs on autos could backfire</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

        <p>Nearly half of the cars sold in the US are imported and Trump’s 25% tariff will add at least $6,000 to the sticker price of the average car, industry experts say</p><p>After two months of flip-flopping on tariffs, imposing them one day and often suspending them the next,Donald Trumpgunned the accelerator of his trade war on Wednesday by announcing a 25% tariff on autos and auto parts imported into the United States. That’s a very big deal, and while the president insists this hefty import tax on cars is going to be good for “anybody who has plants in the United States”, his move – like a car in desperate need of a tune-up – could easily backfire.</p><p>Nearly half of the cars sold in the US are imported, and Trump’s 25% tariff will add at least $6,000 to the sticker price of the average car, industry experts say. Domestic auto producers will be able to jack up their sticker prices because the new tariffs will make US automakers face considerably less price competition from imported cars. This expected sticker shock could anger America’s inflation-weary consumers and voters, especially since candidate Trump had pledged to battle to bring down prices. These higher car prices could cause a quick drop in auto sales in the US, and that could translate into a downturn in auto production, too.</p><p>Trump’s big hope, as well as the United Auto Workers’ big hope, is that the tariffs will encourage automakers – especially GM, Ford and Stellantis (the successor company to Chrysler) – to bring lots of their car production back into the US long term. Shawn Fain, the UAW’s president applauded Trump “for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades”. Fain, an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris, added: “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”</p><p>The UAW has been one of the leading critics of the three-decade-old North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). That union warned that the agreement would do grievous damage to US manufacturing by giving Mexico, a country with far lower wages, free access to the US market. The UAW cautioned that Nafta would be a boon for profit-hungry US corporations, but a bane for US factory workers. The UAW proved correct about that. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive research group, estimates that the US lost 682,000 jobs because of Nafta. (Stellantis makes several models of its Ram pick-up truck in Mexico, while GM makes the electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox there.)</p><p>In a statement released on Wednesday, Fain said: “With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months.” But many industry experts are dubious about that, in effect saying that the UAW should be careful what it wishes for. Trump’s aggressive trade war as well as his on-again, off-again deployment of tariffs has badly shaken consumer and corporate confidence, caused stock markets to tumble and made many economists warn that the strong economy Trump inherited from Biden could sink into recession.</p><p>Slumping consumer confidence, together with soaring sticker prices, could take a serious bite out of US car sales and cause production to sink. In an unhappy forecast, Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, a market research firm, said that as a result of Trump’s auto tariffs, US plants would churn out 20,000 fewer cars per week, about a 30% drop compared with before Trump imposed the tariffs. “By mid-April we expect disruption to virtually all North American vehicle production,” Smoke said in a Wednesday conference call with clients and journalists. “Bottom line: lower production, tighter supply and higher prices are around the corner.”</p><p>As for Trump’s dream that his tariffs will result in far more domestic auto production long term, that could prove elusive. During Trump’s two months back in office, he has disconcerted and discombobulated corporate executives by sowing uncertainty and instability – by his and Elon Musk’s tearing up of the federal government; by his repeatedly flouting federal law and the constitution; and by his imposing tariffs one day, then suspending them the next day, and then reimposing them a few days later. Moreover, Trump has executives fearing an economic downturn, with his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, saying Trump’s policies are “worth it” even if they cause a recession.</p><p>When CEOs are feeling so uncertain due to Trump’s volatility, capriciousness and antics – as well has him changing his mind every few days on trade policy – that Trump-induced sense of instability means auto executives are unlikely to do what Trump wants: to rush to invest a billion or two to build a new auto plant. If Trump and his team had gone about imposing tariffs with a far steadier hand and had made their case in a more thoughtful, non-Trumpian way, then many executives would be far more open to building auto plants and other plants in the US in response to tariffs.</p><p>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce warned that Trump’s auto tariffs could backfire badly. In a statement, the chamber said: “Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America’s auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here. This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.”</p><p>Trump’s sudden announcement on auto tariffs will certainly help him in one way – it made tariffs the nation’s lead news story and pushed to the side those hard-hitting stories about the Trump administration’s acutely embarrassing leak on bombing Yemen. On the other side of the ledger, the tariffs will hurt Trump and the US in a profound way. By imposing a 25% tariff on auto imports from Canada and Mexico, Trump, many trade experts say, is blatantly violating the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a free trade agreement that Trump signed in his first term. (Trump once called it the “best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA”.) Brad Setser, an expert on global trade at the Council of Foreign Relations, said this breach of the USMCA would hurt the US’s credibility and “may raise questions about the value of any future deals Trump signs”.</p><p>For decades, the UAW has been right about the need for Washington to do more to prevent the loss of manufacturing jobs (and to help those workers who lost their factory jobs). But with Trump, the UAW seems to be betting on an unsteady, capricious – and anti-union – general to win a trade war, but as veteran racetrack bettors will tell you, unsteady horses rarely win the race.</p><p>Steven Greenhouse is a labor reporter.</p>

    <h1>Clean energy superpower – and now defence superpower. Can the UK really be both?</h1>

        <p>The government’s plan to ramp up defence spending means relying on carbon-intensive industries – and those won’t be the only policy compromises they have to make</p><p>The UK will become a “defence industrial superpower”, said the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, inWednesday’s spring statement, an ambition that will involve using much more steel, one assumes.</p><p>Now comes news that the Chinese owner of the UK’s second largest steel plantmay close its two blast furnaces as early as June, which would further erode the UK’s already-thin steel-making capabilities. Indeed, closure of Scunthorpe would also mean an end to domestic steel-making from scratch using traditional carbon-intensive blast furnaces – the other two, at Tata’sPort Talbot site, closed last year.</p><p>To make the timing worse, the crisis at Scunthorpe has arrived while the government is still pondering its strategy for steel. A consultation, including an expert review of alternative technologies to make primary steel, closes next Monday. “The central mission of this government is growth. Steel can, and will, have an enormous role to play in driving that growth,”wrote Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, in his introduction. Fine, but what are you going to do about Scunthorpe?</p><p>There are probably three broad options. None will look attractive.</p><p>First, the government could offer Jingye, the Chinese owner, a bigger support package than the reported £500m to underwrite the intended switch to an electric arc furnace (EAF) – the greener tech that is being adopted at Port Talbot and uses mostly recycled steel. The problem with that idea is that talks with Jingye have already been running for two years and the funding gap is said to be enormous.US tariffs on steel importshave compounded existing problems, such as high energy prices.</p><p>Second, the government could allow the blast furnaces to close and hope another steelmaker would accept a support package to build an EAF facility. That sounds risky. The only guaranteed outcome would be that the blast versions would close permanently (these things never reopen) and any newcomer might also want more than £500m.</p><p>The fall-back option is nationalisation. Sheffield Forgemasterswas nationalised by the last government in 2021because it is a critical supplier of parts to the Royal Navy’s ships and submarines. But the aim of the steel consultation was to attract “new private investment” to expand UK steelmaking capability. A detour via temporary nationalisation, as happened after2019’s insolvency at British Steelat a cost of more than £600m to the taxpayer, is not meant to be part of the script.</p><p>The stakes are even higher when you take a step back and ask whether spending more on defence is compatible with another of the government’s big ambitions – the one to be a “clean energy superpower”. Sir Dieter Helm, leading energy economist and former adviser to previous Labour and Conservative governments, asked the question ina lively paper(andaccompanying podcast) last week and its title – Defence and the Retreat from Net Zero – gives away his conclusion.</p><p>Spending more on defence inevitably involves investing in heavy stuff that explodes, uses chemicals or is made in carbon-intensive ways. “Think steel, shells, fighter planes and support ships,” said Helm.</p><p>One of his examples of the strategic challenges is worth quoting at length.</p><p>Sign up toBusiness Today</p><p>Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>“To defend Britain, we need a lot of kit that relies on primary steel (not the weaker recycled form). Imagine, then, that, as a defence policy, we close Port Talbot and the rest of the primary steel production in the UK. We still need the steel. Where will we get it from? Step forward China.</p><p>“Now remember that the PM wants to keep very close to the US. Now imagine China invades Taiwan, and the US calls on Britain to support it – as it did in Afghanistan and Iraq. Perhaps the PM will follow Harold Wilson’s brave rejection of participation in Vietnam. Perhaps not. If the PM does want to stand ‘shoulder to shoulder’ with the US over Taiwan, it is hardly a safe assumption that the supply chain for defence, including the steel from China, is going to stand up.”</p><p>His point is that a serious defence policy needs secure supply chains and energy- and carbon-intensive industries that don’t pass the green test. The Scunthorpe plant itself may be destined for a cleaner furnace eventually, but the mix of steel, defence and net zero ambitions raises deep questions. Setting aside £2.5bn to revive steelmaking in the UK may be easy bit. If Helm is right, there will also be policy compromises.</p>

        <p>About a third of children were living in deprivation even before this week’s benefit cuts. This appalling situation can’t go on</p><p>Arecord 4.5 million children in the UK weregrowing up in povertyin the year to April 2024, according to figures released on Thursday, which provide a chilling backdrop to the government’s newly announced benefit cuts. Staff at a Blackpool charity, Disability First, have received “terrified phone calls” as claimants struggle to understand how the disability benefit reductions in the chancellor’s spring statement will affect them.</p><p>About a third of childrenlive in deprivation. Those with lone parents, or two or more siblings, or in families where someone is disabled are overrepresented among the poorest households. This is hardship of a scale and severity that can be hard to comprehend for those who have not experienced or seen it. Recent research from the Trades Union Congress revealed that 17% of workers surveyed hadskipped a mealto save money over a three-month period. As well as shortages of food, the poorest families face problems with housing and essentials such as clothing, toiletries and furniture. Headteachers have reported pupils being exhausted due to lack of sleep, and distressed by feelings of shame, among poverty’sdetrimental effects.</p><p>Speculation that thetwo-child benefit limitintroduced by George Osborne could soon be abolished, or made more generous to families with pre-school-age children, evaporated in the run-up to Wednesday’s speech. The government’s child poverty strategy is not now expected for months – perhaps around the time of June’s spending review. But these figures are the shocking baseline from which Sir Keir Starmer’s government must advance.</p><p>Some experts had anticipated less bleak data from the final year of Rishi Sunak’s government, due to the boost fromcost of living payments. The combination of the 2023-24 figures with the anticipated effect of Rachel Reeves’s£4.8bn cuts to social securitymeans that the outlook for the poorest households is bleak. The government’s own assessment is that 250,000 more people, including 50,000 children, will be in relative poverty by the end of the decade as a result of the squeeze on welfare. Critics argue that thetrue number could be 100,000 higher.</p><p>Ms Reeves’s insistence in a round of media appearances that she wants people to be richer, not poorer, rang hollow. Investment in job centres should help some benefits claimants into work in due course, if done well. The small uplift in the basic rate of universal credit is welcome. But the chancellor’s decision to prioritise arbitrary fiscal rules above the livelihoods of the poorest people was the wrong one. Any suggestion that cuts on this scale will not hit the living standards of vulnerable families, including children, must be dismissed as nonsense.</p><p>Only in Scotland is there any relief from grim predictions. There,child poverty fell to 22% in 2023‑24– the lowest figure of the UK’s four nations – mainly due to the introduction of the Scottish child payment. The UK government should demonstrate a similar – if belated – commitment to protecting the youngest citizens when its child poverty strategy appears.</p><p>A change of direction and a restatement of what ought to be among Labour’s first principles – that millions of children in one of the world’s richest countries should not be going hungry – is needed. But the signs are that ministers, backbenchers and campaigners who want it will have to fight for it.</p><p>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        <p>The decision to put documents on the assassination of John F Kennedy into the public domain comes alongside a ‘digital book burning’ of data</p><p>What does the public need to know? The Trump White House boasts of being the most transparent administration in history – though commentatorshave suggestedthat the inadvertent leak of military plans to a journalist may have happened because senior figures were using messaging apps such as Signal to avoid oversight. Last week, itreleased thousands of pages of documentson John F Kennedy’s assassination. Donald Trump hasdeclaredthat Kennedy’s family and the American people “deserve transparency and truth”.</p><p>Strikingly, this stated commitment to sharing information comes as his administration defunds data collection and erases existing troves of knowledge from government websites. The main drivers appear to be the desire to remove “woke” content andglobal heating data, and the slashing of federal spending. Information resources are both the target and collateral damage. Other political factors may be affecting federal records too. Last month, Mr Trumpsacked the head of the National Archiveswithout explanation, after grumbling about the body’s involvement in the justice department’s investigation into his handling of classified documents.</p><p>The impact is already painfully evident.Cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationhave affected not only climate records but also anextreme weather risk tool. The purge’s results are absurd as well as damaging. A webpage on the Enola Gay, the aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, appears to have beenmarked for deletionbecause it was mistaken for a reference to LGBTQ+ issues.</p><p>Yet the disparity between the data dump on the Kennedy assassination and the removal of other material is not a contradiction. It speaks volumes about the administration’s approach to truth and knowledge, which it regards as contingent and a matter of convenience. (Tellingly, it is alsoaxingthe body that provides most federal funding to libraries.)</p><p>The 1963 presidential assassination is not only an event around which multiple theories circle but one that helped feed a broader culture of conspiracy theorising and distrust in authority. That has metastatised to the bizarre and extreme claims embraced and even promoted by Mr Trump or figures around him, includingbirtherism,PizzagateandQAnon. These increasingly fantastical narratives have had real-world consequences. Facts, science and rationality itself are under attack.</p><p>In his first term, Mr Trump’s aides shamelesslypromoted “alternative facts”while decrying actual facts as “fake news”. The Washington Posttallied more than 30,000 false or misleading claimsover those four years. This time round, his administration is removing existing sources of information. Websites, datasets and other informationvanished from federal health websites– such as that for the Centers for Disease Control – last month, though some has since reappeared. One scientistcalledit “a digital book burning”. The Union of Concerned Scientistshas warnedthat “critically important science conducted at many US agencies, institutions, and universities [is] under increasing assault”.</p><p>Ad hoc preservation of essential national information and records is usually the work of those faced with the destructive force offoreign invasions,jihadist insurgenciesor dictators. But as this bonfire blazes, a motley but committed array of individuals – “nerds who care”,in the words of one– are fighting back by preserving data before it is deleted. Their admirable effort to defend the truth deserves support.</p><p>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        <p>Data published on day after Labour announces cuts that analysts say will hit children and disabled people hardest</p><p>Campaigners have said it is “morally repugnant” that vulnerable people are bearing the brunt of spending cuts after official figures showed a record 4.5 million children are living in poverty in the UK.</p><p>The figures, released on Thursday, showan extra 100,000 children were living below the breadlinein the year to April 2024 – the final full year of child poverty statistics for the last Conservative government. It is the third year running that child poverty has increased.</p><p>Food poverty and hunger also rose, according to official surveys, with 300,000 more children in households reliant on food banks over the previous 12 months, and an increase in children in food insecure families, meaning they struggled to afford regular and healthy meals.</p><p>Just under a third of UK children (28%) experienced material deprivation, a measure designed to assess whether households are able to afford basics that constitute a minimum acceptable standard of living, such as food, clothes, toys and school trips.</p><p>Separate analysis by a leading thinktank has found living standards for lower-income households are on track to fall further by the end of the decade as a result of the chancellor’s spring statement.</p><p>A combination of weak economic growth over the next five years and benefit cuts that fell disproportionately on lower-income households would result in an average annual loss of £500 in 2030 for those in the poorest half of the population, according to theResolution Foundation.</p><p>Campaigners warned poverty would continue to increase underLabourunless it took firm action to reverse the trend such as by axing the two-child benefit cap in its child poverty strategy, expected in June.</p><p>Labour’s general election manifesto promised an “ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty” alongside a commitment to end “mass dependence” on food banks and charity food handouts, which it called “a moral scar on our society”.</p><p>Alison Garnham, the chief executive of ChildPovertyAction Group and vice-chair of End Child Poverty, said: “Today’s grim statistics are a stark warning that the government’s own commitment to reduce child poverty will crash and burn unless it takes urgent action.”</p><p>Silvia Galandini, of the poverty charity Oxfam, said: “We live in the sixth-richest country in the world where billionaires alone saw their wealth soar by £11bn last year. It is morally repugnant that children, disabled people and carers are the ones who are taking the hit.”</p><p>The annual poverty figures were published by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) a day after the government cameunder fire from its own backbenchersover the impact of itscuts to disability and incapacity benefits, which willpush 50,000 childrenand 200,000 disabled adults into relative hardship by the end of the decade.</p><p>Just over 370,000 people who currently claim Pip will lose eligibility asa result of the cuts, while another 430,000 who would have been eligible for the benefit in the future will not now get it. On average they will lose £4,500 a year.</p><p>The annual households below average income report shows that even before these cuts come into effect, disabled families are already experiencing high levels of poverty – 44% of all children living in poverty were living in a household where someone has a disability.</p><p>Sign up toFirst Edition</p><p>Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>Separate data published on Thursday by the DWP from its family resources survey showed just under a third of households (31%) where someone claims Pip disability benefit were food insecure.</p><p>The poverty figures showed that in Scotland 23% of children were in poverty, compared with 31% in England and Wales. Holyrood missed its 18% poverty figure target, though experts said its rates would be higher without its child poverty programme.</p><p>Prof Ruth Patrick, a professor in social policy at the University of York, said: “The progress Scotland has made on driving poverty rates down shows another way is possible. The UK government could lift 700,000 children out of poverty overnight by matching Scotland’s fiscal commitment to driving poverty down.”</p><p>Peter Matejic, the chief analyst at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “The inheritance of the new government was a third consecutive year of rising child poverty and a second year in a row of falling incomes, both alarming symptoms of a deep crisis in living standards.”</p><p>At a protest outside parliament on Thursday morning, Liv Eren, a youth ambassador for the End Child Poverty coalition who grew up in poverty, said the government’s cuts were “an act of self-harm”.</p><p>“We know that more children are going to be pushed into poverty, but they’re choosing to do it anyway. I feel quite angry,” she said. “This was a government that said they wanted to bring change, and stood at the dispatch box time and time again, having a go at Tory politicians for the child poverty rate, and yet at the earliest opportunity, they’re not bringing change.”</p><p>A DWP spokesperson said: “No one should be living in poverty, and we know that the best route out of poverty for struggling families is well paid, secure work. That is why we are reforming our broken welfare system so it helps people into good jobs, boosting living standards and putting money in people’s pockets.”</p>

    <h1>RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney wins confidence vote as grassroots revolt fails</h1>

        <p></p><p>The RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has survived a vote of no confidence in his leadership at a special general meeting at the Allianz Stadium.</p><p>A motion of no confidence in Sweeney and proposal for the RFU directors to terminate his contract was rejected by 466 votes to 206 after an 80-minute meeting.</p><p>There were 36 abstentions, with the 708 votes registered representing the biggest turnout in an RFU vote for more than 20 years, albeit still little more than 50% of the membership. A second motion brought by the RFU, proposing greater devolution of powers to the regions to address local issues, was passed with an 80% majority.</p><p>The RFU interim chair, Bill Beaumont, called for unity after the vote and described the outcome as “emphatic” in his closing address, but the wounds of this long-running dispute will take some time to heal. The trigger for this revolt led by the Whole Game Union, an alliance of Championship, grassroots clubs and refereeing bodies, was the revelation in November that Sweeney received a £358,000 bonus last year, taking his overall remuneration to £1.1m, despite the RFU reporting losses of £37.9m.</p><p>“This is not a time to argue, but to pull together,” Beaumont said. “The time for division is past. Now is the time to unite behind an opportunity to renew English rugby.</p><p>“Let us put behind this period of in-fighting and modernise the union. Let’s get back to focusing on the many positives in our game. Every single player who puts that white shirt on started off in community rugby – every single one of them.”</p><p>The final decision on Sweeney’s future lies with the RFU board, but it has backed him throughout and after he received almost 66% of the vote, the RFU views the result as an endorsement of his position.</p><p>Sweeney did not speak during or after the meeting, but received the strong backing of the former international referee and RFU board member Wayne Barnes.</p><p>“One thing that rugby has always told me is that if there are two sides to an argument, when the referee makes a decision, you move on,” Barnes said. “What we’ve seen tonight is a decision being made by the members. And quite a strong decision, 66% of the vote saying that Bill Sweeney should remain.</p><p>“We’ve had a clear instruction to move on with what we’ve learnt over the last few months. Sir Bill Beaumont has been around the clubs, listening, understanding what the concerns of the game are. We want to action them. We will challenge our executive team to do exactly what they have been tasked to do.”</p><p>Sign up toThe Breakdown</p><p>The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>Having previously threatened to petition for a second SGM including a motion for the entire RFU board to resign if they were defeated, representatives of the Whole Game Union sounded a more conciliatory tone last night. The Nottingham chair, Alistair Bow, welcomed the devolution of power and said the clubs would continue to hold the RFU to account, with 11 proposals for further governance changes to be presented at their AGM in June.</p><p>“I think the result was not as important as what comes next,” Bow said. “What I think we have seen is a very strong support for change. When you look at the numbers [in support of Sweeney] I think that clearly shows you that there’s a big problem in the game.</p><p>“If it was in the corporate world, as a CEO you would be in a spot of bother, you wouldn’t be surviving. What has been said tonight is that clubs want change and they are expecting to see change.</p><p>“I think the strong message from speaking to Bill Sweeney and Bill Beaumont afterwards is that we’re going to see change. I think they know that the world has been looking at us tonight and the rugby public are expecting to see change. We’re going to see how that plays out. Hopefully we can work together. The hard work starts today.”</p>

    <h1>Red Bull need to adapt fast and that is why they axed Liam Lawson</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

        <p>The dismissal of the New Zealander and his replacement by the more experienced Yuki Tsunoda illustrates fundamental problems with the RB21</p><p>Red Bull’sdismissal of Liam Lawsonafter only two races was a ruthless decision, brutal even by their standards. Yet while it was neither unexpected nor particularly surprising, there is more to it than simple dissatisfaction with an underperforming driver. Replacing him with Yuki Tsunoda was a U-turn that indicates fundamental problems the team are facing, ones to which they are unlikely to find a quick fix, and that Max Verstappen is unhappy at their performance and indeed their prospects for the new season.</p><p>Lawson, who had already looked shell-shocked by the close of the second race in China last weekend, was left entreating the team to give him just a little more time.Red Bullwere not forthcoming. On Thursday morning they announced he would be replaced by Tsunoda from their sister team, RB, the Japanese driver having originally been passed over for the seat in Lawson’s favour at the end of last season.</p><p>The New Zealander was less experienced but expected to be better able to come up to speed and to come closer to matching Verstappen, the defending world champion, but it really did not go to plan. He endured the worst sequence of qualifying in the team’s history, 18th in Australia, 19th for the sprint in China and 20th for the GP. He crashed out in the Melbourne race and went pointless in both races at Shanghai.</p><p>Far from being close to Verstappen he was not even that close to the midfield, flailing with a car he could barely manage and with no obvious indication that he was going to come to terms with it, although two races is a very short time for anyone with only 11 grands prix under his belt to have a handle on a brand new ride.</p><p>So Red Bull pulled the trigger. Yet it is impossible not to surmise there was more to it than Lawson not being up to scratch. The team are simply not where they expected to be at the start of this season. Having endured the second half of last year with a car that was unstable and sorely lacking in balance – which Verstappen nonetheless still managed to drag to the title – the target had been to address the issues over the winter and come back with a solid drive for the Dutchman’s defence and to vie for the constructors’ championship.</p><p>In the statement announcing the switch,Christian Hornerconceded as much. “We acknowledge there is a lot of work to be done with the RB21,” the team principal said. Which in F1 terms is a seismic admission from a man in his position. The expected development of the car has not been achieved and even in Verstappen’s hands it is at best still well behind the McLaren and perhaps struggling to match the Mercedes.</p><p>When they took Lawson on, this was not expected to be the case but given it is then Tsunoda, with 89 grands prix under his belt, suddenly looks the better option to help work through the problems, as Horner acknowledged. “Yuki’s experience will prove highly beneficial in helping to develop the current car,” he said.</p><p>Red Bull enjoyed a hugely dominant car in 2022 and 2023, especially, but the direction it has gone in since has not proved beneficial, while the opposition has caught up and in McLaren’s case leapt ahead. Verstappen has been making this point for no short time now and doubtless is not satisfied that the shortcomings remain. That he is less than impressed with the team’s handling of the situation might be gauged by the fact that he liked a post on Instagram by the former F1 driver Giedo van der Garde, who described Red Bull’s treatment of Lawson as “closer to bullying or a panic move”.</p><p>Sign up toThe Recap</p><p>The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>Verstappen’s talent, then, has masked the limitations and deficiencies that the team have failed to sort out and Red Bull are now paying the price. Tsunoda must be seen as part of the process of addressing this, and Lawson almost as collateral damage. Yet in mitigation for the New Zealander, there is another fundamental hurdle for any number-two driver at Red Bull and that is that the car has long been designed to suit the strengths of their world champion.</p><p>Verstappen enjoys a very pointy front to the car, with oversteer, to enjoy a sharp turn-in to the corner, ramped up as far as possible. “That’s where [he] excels,” said Horner in China. “That’s where he’s able to live on a knife’s edge of adhesion and he’s just constantly asking for more and more front out of the car.”</p><p>The side effect of this, as Horner noted, is that it makes the rear of the car unsettled, loose on corner entry, which can be enormously hard to control and adapt to, especially if you are new to it. Which, in turn, can grind away at the confidence, leaving drivers bereft and questioning their own abilities. Sergio Pérez was nowhere near as woeful a driver as his performances for the last two years at Red Bull suggested but he simply could not handle the car. Lawson replaced him only to find himself in similar deep water and now Tsunoda has a shot at this poisoned chalice.</p><p>He will face a similarly tough challenge, a huge test of his skill and his mettle, but for Red Bull his appointment is part of a far bigger picture. They need to adapt, to develop and to do it fast, and it is Tsunoda’s potential ability to cope with the fundamental frailties of the car and deliver feedback on how to fix it that has put him in the hot seat. If he too is found wanting, Red Bull have very few options left.</p>

    <h1>The Atlantic handled ‘Signalgate’ with good judgment</h1>

        <p>Shining a bright spotlight on this mess was a public service. One can only imagine what other information has been as recklessly handled</p><p>Over the past six months or so, the Atlantic has been assembling more and more reporting talent, including by poaching some of the biggest stars from the troubled Washington Post.</p><p>One of the best intelligence reporters in the country is Shane Harris, who moved from the Post to the Atlantic last summer.</p><p>Harris shared the byline this week on the Atlantic’s shocking scoop, in which top editor Jeffrey Goldberg inadvertently was given access to a group text where top US officials were planning a strike in Yemen.</p><p>Before they published and at every step along the way, the Atlantic conferred with knowledgable lawyers about how to proceed. The journalists revealed what they had in stages, and carefully.</p><p>The Atlantic thus was a model of caution and good judgment.</p><p>“Jeff Goldberg and The Atlantic handled the whole thing perfectly,” Martin Baron, the renowned editor who led the Washington Post newsroom until 2021, told me in an email on Thursday.</p><p>The journalists’ actions “could be a college journalism class in careful, ethical handling of sensitive information”, said David Boardman, dean of Temple University’s media school.</p><p>The contrast was sharp between those well-considered measures and the dangerous negligence at the highest level of theTrump administration. One awful thing is that this incompetence is baked in; in a very real sense it is intentional. Just as “the cruelty is the point,” as writer Adam Serwer said years ago of Trump World, so is the bumbling.</p><p>It’s an offshoot of the only thing that really matters to Trump: loyalty.</p><p>“Carelessness – or any of the injurious attributes of clowns, idiots and buffoons – is something Trump can trust,” noted John Stoehr, who writes The Editorial Board, a politics newsletter. “When things go south, as they will, he can trust them to cling to him more tightly, as by then, he might be the only thing standing between them and a jail cell.”</p><p>Here’s one telling detail. When Tim Miller on the Bulwark’s daily podcast asked Goldberg about the covert CIA operative who was named in the text thread, the Atlantic editor said he purposely withheld her name.</p><p>“I didn’t put it in the story because she’s under cover. But, I mean, the CIA director put it in the chat.”</p><p>Yet, inevitably, Trump loyalists responded by trashing Goldberg and the Atlantic. Always attack, as Trump learned decades ago at the knee of the disgraced lawyer Roy Cohn.</p><p>Thus, Goldberg was described as sleazy, and the magazine itself as hyper-partisan and failing.</p><p>The press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called the story “another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin”.</p><p>You would have to be plenty credulous or truth-averse to buy that, and much of Maga Nation is just that, including those who relied on Fox News – where, soon after the story broke, prime-time host Jesse Watters made himself part of the defense team: “Journalists like Goldberg will sometimes send out fake names with a contact with their cells to deceive politicians. … This wouldn’t surprise me if Goldberg sneaked his way in.”</p><p>Sign up toFollow Margaret Sullivan</p><p>Sign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>The Atlantic’s CEO, Nick Thompson, noted the contrast: “One lesson from this story: how honest, consistent and careful with national security the best reporters are, compared to the people who always attack them.”</p><p>Pete Hegseth, the Fox News personality turned defense secretary, played the blame game rather than concede his culpability. “You’re talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist,” Hegseth said of Goldberg.</p><p>Granted, a scintilla of acknowledgment came from the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who said “somebody” made a mistake by adding a journalist to the chat, but that didn’t begin to touch the utter lack of security provisions that were laid bare – the apparent use of personal devices by these powerful officials, the reliance on Signal, the messaging app that’s inappropriate for such uses, and so much more.</p><p>That Goldberg and the magazine are being targeted by Trump and others in his government, Baron told me, was a sign of the administration’s “desperation, its unwillingness to accept responsibility for its own egregious blunders and the hollowness of its attacks on the media”. Just so.</p><p>Shining a bright spotlight on this mess was a public service. One can only imagine what other information has been as recklessly handled.</p><p>Maybe this revelation will prevent future lapses, though with this crowd in charge I wouldn’t count on it. Instead, we’ll see punitive leak investigations and even more efforts to control information.</p><p>Still, this chapter does show the value of conscientious journalism in an increasingly dangerous environment.</p><p>There has been plenty of sleaziness on display in recent days – but it has nothing to do with the Atlantic’s exemplary reporting.</p><p>Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture</p>

        <p>Support for Ukraine continues with divided opinion on Franco-British plan for ‘reassurance force’ to help ceasefire</p><p>European leaders have affirmed their support forUkraineat a Paris summit and agreed now was “not the time” to lift sanctions against Russia, but with splits remaining on Franco-British plans for a “reassurance force” to help guarantee an eventual ceasefire.</p><p>France’s president,Emmanuel Macron, said on Thursday the meeting of more than two dozen heads of state and government had agreed unanimously that sanctions on Moscow should not be eased until “peace has clearly been established” in Ukraine.</p><p>The third meeting of what France and the UK have called the “coalition of the willing” for Ukraine was called amid widespread concern thatDonald Trumpmay be open to rolling back some sanctions in order to get Russia to agree to a partial ceasefire deal.</p><p>“Ukraine had the courage to accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire,” Macron said after the summit, also attended by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, and the heads of theEuropean Commissionand council.</p><p>“Since that Ukrainian announcement, there has been no Russian response,” Macron said. “There have just been new conditions posed [by Moscow] for a much more limited and hypothetical ceasefire.”</p><p>The British prime minister,Keir Starmer, said there was “complete clarity” on the importance of not lifting sanctions, with leaders “on the contrary” discussing how sanctions could be increased “to support the US initiative to bring Russia to the table” with further pressure.</p><p>Starmer told reporters at the British embassy after the summit: “It means increasing the economic pressure on Russia, accelerating new tougher sanctions bearing down on Russia’s energy revenues and working together to make this pressure count.”</p><p>He added that he did not believeVladimir Putinwas negotiating in good faith. Starmer said: “It’s clear the Russians are filibustering. They are playing games and then playing for time. It is a classic from the Putin playbook.”</p><p>Putin last night suggested Ukraine could be placed under a form of temporary administration to allow for new elections and the signature of key accords with the aim of reaching a settlement, Russian news agencies reported.</p><p>In a separate briefing, the German chancellor,Olaf Scholz, said lifting sanctions on Russia would be a grave mistake and “makes no sense” as long as peace had “not actually been achieved – and unfortunately we are still a long way from that”.</p><p>Zelenskyy said Russia “does not want any kind of peace” but instead “wants to divideEuropeand America”, and there should be “no lifting of any kind of sanctions until Russia stops this war”. Instead, there should be “more packages of sanctions”.</p><p>Zelenskyy added after the summit that he felt the US should respond to what he called Moscow’s violation of a commitment not to strike Ukrainian energy targets. “I think there should be a reaction from the US,” he said.</p><p>The meeting sought to define the security guarantees the European and other allies could offer Ukraine once a ceasefire was agreed to end the three-year-old war – including the possible deployment of military forces by some of its members.</p><p>Facing political and logistical constraints and possible Russian and US resistance, coalition members are far from agreed on the latter option. Anglo-French plans for a post-truce “reassurance force” had not won universal backing, Macron said.</p><p>The force was “a British-French proposition, desired by Ukraine”, he said, adding: “It does not have unanimity, but we do not need unanimity to do this.” Nonetheless, an Anglo-French delegation would soon travel to Ukraine to discuss needs, he said.</p><p>Sign up toHeadlines Europe</p><p>A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>The French president said “several” of Ukraine’s European allies were prepared to deploy to Ukraine, but some did not “have the necessary capacity” and others were reluctant to put troops on the ground due to the “political context”.</p><p>Italy’s prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, repeated Rome’s refusal to send troops to defend any ceasefire deal, adding that it was “important to continue working with the US” and she hoped a US delegation would attend the next coalition meeting.</p><p>Macron said the reassurance force, stationed away from the frontline but offering strategic support, could form part of a security guarantee that also included more support for the Ukrainian army and a broader push to rearm by coalition members.</p><p>The UK-France mission would also discuss the shape of “tomorrow’s Ukraine army”, Macron said, emphasising the importance of a “strong Ukrainian army … that is well equipped for the day after”.</p><p>Starmerconfirmed that French, British and also Germanarmy chiefs would travel to Kyiv to help with planning support for Ukraine’s army, with a new Ukraine defence contact group to meet “to marshal more military aid and keep Ukraine in the fight”.</p><p>Zelenskyy said there were “many questions” and “few answers” on the possible deployment of European troops and “the actions of this contingent, its responsibilities – what it can do, how it can be used, who will be in charge of it”.</p><p>Starmer said the Paris meeting had made progress “in terms of numbers and intent”, but could not say how many countries were willing to deploy troops to Ukraine, nor whether he was any closer in securing support for such an idea from Washington.</p><p>Pushed to say how long he would give Putin to respond positively to the ceasefire proposals, the British prime minister said: “We need to see this developing in days and weeks, not months and months.”</p>

    <h1>Richard Wigglesworth: ‘I’ll be honest … and think of nothing but the Lions’</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

        <p>Newly selected British & Irish Lions assistant on his journey as a coach, picking Steve Borthwick’s brain and Andy Farrell breaking the news</p><p>Richard Wigglesworth was in the garden with his five-year-old daughter, two days after England’s thumping win over Wales, when the phone rang. It was Andy Farrell and as much as Margot was not happy that her father was on the phone, it was a call he had to take. England’s storming finish to the Six Nations may not be the only reason Wigglesworth has beenseconded to the British & Irish Lionsbut it can only have helped, and so the 41-year-old completes Farrell’s lineup, the first England coach to do so since Steve Borthwick in 2017.</p><p>It is easy to forget that more than two years ago, Wigglesworth was still playing for Leicester Tigers. He was a player-coach when Borthwick got the call from England in December 2022 and as a result, Wigglesworth immediately hung up his boots and took interim charge at Welford Road.</p><p>By the end of the season, after losing a Premiership semi-final to Sale, he had joined up with Borthwick at England, first as attack coach before graduating to senior coach in October last year. When explaining why he selected Wigglesworth, Farrell spoke effusively of how the former scrum-half had thrown himself into coaching, off the deep end, and theirs is a relationship that goes back a while. “I love his story, I know him, I know what makes him tick,” said Farrell. “I love the determination, the courage, the ambition that he had from being a player-coach, to having the balls to take on a head coach job when he had no clue what that entailed.”</p><p>Farrell was just cutting his coaching teeth with Saracens when Wigglesworth was persuaded to join the north London club as a player and the pair were reunited when Farrell was appointed as Stuart Lancaster’s defence coach with England. Indeed, Farrell was a significant influence in convincing Wigglesworth to join Saracens.</p><p>“He was part of the coaching staff that signed me in 2010,” recalls Wigglesworth. “I’d come down from Sale and didn’t expect to sign, but he along with the others were really persuasive. He’d shown me round where you might live. I remember getting out of the car and the last thing he said was, ‘Wiggy, have you got the balls to do it?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, I have!’ That was my first memory of Big Faz.”</p><p>When the call came last Monday, there was not nearly as much persuading to do. “It was last Monday and I was back on duty after the Six Nations and Margot was wanting to play outside, so I was picking up the ball around with her and saw Faz’s name pop up and thought, ‘let’s answer this’. Yeah … an incredible moment.”</p><p>Wigglesworth did not tour with the Lions as a player – of Farrell’s five-strong coaching staff only Simon Easterby did – but in Borthwick he has the perfect sounding board. The England head coach was part of Warren Gatland’s staff for the series draw with New Zealand in 2017 and Wigglesworth will go to Australia with his blessing. “It was brilliant for me and accelerated my coaching, so I’d love as many other people from the England group to be in there as possible, and I’ll be fully supportive of them all,” said Borthwick.</p><p>Sign up toThe Breakdown</p><p>The latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewed</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>Wigglesworth added: “Steve was awesome. He knew before me but was obviously waiting for me to get the call and offer from Andy. He was delighted for me. He’s been a big part of my coaching journey so I thanked him for that. I’ll be picking his brains on what it looks like, but he did say that one of his rugby highlights was coaching the Lions as an assistant, so I’m looking forward to catching up with him about that.”</p><p>Now that Farrell has named his assistants he can look forward to his squad announcement on 8 May with his coaches recuperating after the Six Nations before casting an eye over domestic matches in the coming weeks. Wigglesworth is adamant he does not see it as his job to bang the drum for England players’ selection but certainly Farrell will be aware of what his new assistant was able to achieve, rounding off the recent campaign with a10-try win in Cardiff.</p><p>“I’m a Lions coach, my responsibility is to every player from the British Isles and Ireland, to work as hard as I can to get up to speed with their strengths and what they could bring,” says Wigglesworth. “It’ll be the same for any player. I will be as honest as I can because it is going to require us all to put everything aside and think of nothing but the Lions to have a chance of success.”</p>

I remember Noel denied that he had said anything of the sort. I said to him: ‘Why would Maya make that up?’”</p><p>The producer said he had not believed Clarke, 49, during what he told the court was a “combative” conversation.</p><p>“Noel was very resistant and belligerent during this conversation,” the producer said. “When Noel said that we would need to get a different actress to replace Maya. I distinctly remember saying to him words to the effect, ‘You’ve been saying we’re going to fuck later to her – surely you can see where that leads? Do you really want to end up on the front of a national newspaper? As that’s the way this is going.’ In response, Noel told me to ‘fuck off’.”</p><p>The producer was giving evidence as a witness for Guardian News and Media (GNM), the publisher of the Guardian, in its defence against a libel claim by Clarke relating to seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March 2022 accusing him of sexual misconduct.</p><p>Clarke denies putting pressure on Maya over the sex scene or acting inappropriately. He has said he apologised to her in a phone call for one comment in which he recalled saying something like, “don’t worry, you look great”, in order to “boost her confidence”.</p><p>Cross-examining the producer, Philip Williams, representing Clarke, suggested the account was not true and asked why it was that Maya went on to send Clarke friendly messages after working with him. The court heard that Maya had also thanked Clarke for making her feel “at ease” during an initial audition.</p><p>The producer responded that he was not aware of what happened after they had worked together but that he would have been “pleased” if they had been reconciled.</p><p>A female producer on the same production said she had also been informed by Maya that Clarke was pressuring her to be naked during the sex scene and that she felt he was “coming on to her because he was being leery and suggestive”.</p><p>Asked about the later apparent friendliness in messages between Clarke and Maya, the producer responded that it did not surprise her as “that’s how it was” for women in the business when dealing with powerful people.</p><p>A female runner on the same production told the court that Maya had told her that Clarke was “bullying her and undermining her, saying to her she would ‘never make it’, and insinuating that he could ruin her career and that she was only in this show because of him”.</p><p>She added: “Maya said she felt she was in a #MeToo situation with Noel.”</p><p>Clarke’s barrister suggested that Maya was already a successful actor by that stage and that the former runner had been mistaken in her evidence, which she denied.</p><p>He asked whether she was a “driver” of the #MeToo movement. “I’m supportive of it but I don’t engage on a daily basis,” she said.</p><p>The court also heard from Lisa Graham, who claimed that Clarke had “put his hand over my thigh and in-between my legs” while she had been assisting him as a volunteer at a convention centre in Bournemouth in 2016.</p><p>Graham claimed that his hand had gone “an inch or two from my panty line”, forcing her to physically move her chair away from him.</p><p>She further claimed that Clarke had repeatedly proposed that they “go upstairs and have sex” and ranked passing women on their sexual attractiveness, including a pregnant woman who he said he would “bang” because “you can’t put another baby in them”.</p><p>Clarke denies the claims. His barrister accused Graham of misinterpreting the conversation and jumping on a bandwagon.</p><p>She denied the accusation, telling the court that she had been forced to “relive things that I did not want to have to relive” but that she had decided that speaking out was the “right thing to do”.</p><p>A final witness, Garry Moore, an amateur film-maker, told the court that Clarke had shown him a clip of a female actor named as Florence in a scene in which she was naked. He said he had been “shocked” that Clarke had the footage on his phone.</p><p>Put to him by the claimant’s junior barrister, Arthur Lo, that this was part of the process of selecting an actor for a part, Moore said they were not at that stage and that he believed Clarke simply wanted to “show that he could get actresses to do anything that he wanted”.</p><p>The trial continues.</p>

        <p>Readers express their dismay at Rachel Reeves’s spring statement, with some lifelong party members feeling no longer able to support it</p><p>ManyLaboursupporters, including myself, have waited a decade and a half for Labour to return to government and bring about a sea change in the governance of the country. We are now beginning to wonder why we bothered. Labour in opposition promised to ensure that the public would see a significant improvement in essential public services and in their economic wellbeing, but there is a fundamental flaw and inherent dishonesty in this government pretending it can achieve this while adopting an economic policy clothed in a self-imposed straitjacket.</p><p>Rachel Reeves’s spring statement (Rachel Reeves accused of balancing books on back of UK’s poorest, 26 March) further exacerbates the chasm between her party’s ambitions in opposition and its achievements in government. A year ago, Frances Ryan asked:What’s the point of Starmer’s Labour if it won’t stand up for poor, sick or disabled people?That is just one of the questions that many of us are beginning to ask.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire</p><p>“Welfare savings from withdrawing or cutting incapacity benefits”; “Thousands of public sector jobs to go”; “Government departments facing major cuts to their budgets”.Sound familiar? Headlines from George Osborne’s spending review in 2010. That went really well, didn’t it? Good job Labour has learned lessons from that. Still, at least it saved money by copying and pasting from it.Peter LoschiOldham, Greater Manchester</p><p>So all disabled people who want to work will be supported in obtaining secure and well-paid jobs as part of Labour’s drive to reduce welfare costs and get Britain working. I recall a previous Labour government targeting disabled people bywithdrawing financial support to some Remployfactories under the guise of helping those people affected to secure work in open employment. As feared at the time by disability groups, the reality was that the scheme was really about reducing welfare costs.</p><p>The majority of people who lost their job at a Remploy factory faced long-term unemployment and loss of independence and self-worth. History will repeat itself with this Labour government’s shameless attack on disabled people.John MaherLiverpool</p><p>I am sickened that a Labour chancellor, confronted with an unfavourable financial forecast, thinks the only course of action is to expect the poorest in society to have their income reduced to fill the gap. Our system is awash with tax breaks for the better-off.Rachel Reevesis behaving exactly as I would expect a Tory chancellor to, which is not what I, or the rest of those who voted Labour, wanted out of a new government.John RennieGerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire</p><p>Like Jon Burnell (Letters, 25 March), I too am appalled by this Labour government. As a member since 1960, I see a party that is led by a former human rights lawyer who cannot tolerate dissent, that echoes the cruelty of the last Conservative government, and that implements economic policies which seek to penalise the most needy and vulnerable. I have started to ask myself when does loyalty become an endorsement of the unacceptable? I am going to find it very difficult to renew my membership next year.George RedmanNew Eltham, London</p><p>Do you think Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves and the rest of this welfare-cutting cabinet can wash the lower halves of their bodies themselves? I just cannot believe that it is a Labour government that is targeting disabled people in such a shameful way. We would have been a better society under another Rishi Sunak government – and I have been a Labour voter all my long life. I can’t vote Labour now, not while this lot are in power.Pat StaplesSouthampton</p><p>I have been a Labour supporter all my life, but I am appalled by the spring statement. I know that Rachel Reeves loves savings, so I have today resigned my Labour membership and will be donating the money saved to Save the Children instead.Nick RozanskiLondon</p><p>If that’s not austerity, I’m a spring onion!Jol MiskinSheffield</p><p>Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        <p>Brian Unwinhighlights just how much long-term financing has been lost through leaving the EU. ButFawzi Ibrahimsays sovereignty is priceless</p><p>Polly Toynbee (Rachel Reeves is all about growth. So why won’t she admit that Brexit is its worst enemy?, 25 March) demonstrates conclusively how much self-inflicted economic damage the UK is suffering from Brexit. She could also have mentioned the critical loss of investment from the EU’s long-term financing bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB).</p><p>During the UK’s EU membership, the EIB invested some £150bn in mainly infrastructure projects in the UK, representing actual investment of two to three times that amount, taking account of the EIB’s ability to attract other long-term co-financers. This key stream of investment and growth ceased with Brexit, and the successor regional investment banks established by the government havenot come remotely nearto replacing the EIB’s level of finance. If, as Toynbee urges, the government were bold enough to face down the Brexiters, there would be at least an opportunity to renegotiate access to EIB finance. No other source of significant investment is in prospect.Brian UnwinPresident,European Investment Bank, 1993-2000</p><p>Polly Toynbee asserts that leaving the EU has cost the country “huge sums”. This may or may not be true. But I do remember being told by the same people that voting to leave would crush the economy and cause the pound to plummet, turning sterling into junk.</p><p>Immediately after the BBC projected a leave win on referendum night, the pound did dive, to a chorus of “I told you so” from politicians and pundits. But, like a phoenix, it soon rose up as the markets and people across the world realised that there is something to be said for independence and national sovereignty.</p><p>If one is to follow Toynbee’s logic, the Canadians better agree to be the 51st state of the US if they are to avoid their economy wrecked by tariffs from across their southern border. But Canadians know that independence and sovereignty cannot be weighed against pounds and pence; they are priceless.Fawzi IbrahimNational officer, Trade Unions Against the EU</p><p>Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

    <h1>Donald Trump is moving fast and breaking things, but that may result in a better US</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>The chance of the president succeeding in his radicalism is small, but amid the chaos are challenges to convention that were overdue</p><p>“Move fast and break things” was Mark Zuckerberg’s motto in launching Facebook 20 years ago. It seemed the antithesis of management-school custom and practice. But it worked, to be imitated after a fashion by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and other digital tycoons with similar success.Donald Trumpis now seeing if it works in government.</p><p>The smart money in Washington was that after the fiasco of Trump’s first term, his second would see a more emollient president, one careful of his reputation. He would reach out, consult, become a peacemaker, in his desperation to become aNobel presidentlike Barack Obama.</p><p>How wrong that has proved. Trump is doing what few leaders dare do. He is being a cultural revolutionary, a Mao Zedong, a grandiloquent system smasher. He wants to reorder Washington’s role in the US and the US’s role in the world. He knows that he may have just two years before “the system” – the electoral cycle, the judiciary and state governments – blocks his path. If he truly wants revolution he must break things, and fast.</p><p>The historianArthur Schlesingersaid the US needed occasional shocks to wipe away the cobwebs, the bureaucracy and the dirt of an ever more cumbersome union. Should it get out of hand and disaster threaten, the constitution was designed to pull the country back from the brink. Thus it rid itself of Richard Nixon, but not before his radicalism towards China achieved the US’s exit from Vietnam. Might this apply to Trump?</p><p>Already a dose of the so-called new realism has torn through Nato’s cobwebs. Trump simply does not regard Russia as a threat to the US and western Europe. It is merely obsessed, as it has been throughout history, with its frontier states, with the Baltics, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia and the “stans”, nations that Trump has little interest in defending. Yet ever since the end of the cold war – and during most of it – Nato’s rationale has relied on a thesis, a conventional wisdom, that Russia is set on the conquest of western Europe. If Keir Starmer really thinks, as he appears to, that Russia’s assault on Ukraine threatens Britain, Trump’s message is that Britain should pare down its welfare state and rearm quickly. American taxpayers are not going to be taken for that ride.</p><p>It was indeed a Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, who warned against exaggerating the Russian threat to sustain Nato, which was already the biggest and richest military establishment the world had ever seen. The defence lobby demanded deterrence to be infinite. Trump has called that bluff. To him the US’s defence is just that: to guard its own borders. So should be Europe’s. It is hardly an outrageous view. No one was screaming for war when Russia invaded Georgia or Ukraine in 2014. It is one thing to disagree with this argument, another to dismiss it as 1939-style appeasement, as western defence lobbyists have done.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the subject of borders Trump is hardly out on a limb. The US gainsabout 150,000Mexican immigrants a year, to join the11 million already there. Mexico and Canada bombard the US with imports, as does China. To Trump, Americans should pay for their goods what it costs Americans to make them. If they want Chinese cars they candonate 25%of the price to the government as a tariff. As for fentanyl, the way to get countries such as China to stem the flow and the deaths that follow is againwith tariffs, massive tariffs. Sometimes in diplomacy only force talks – force backed up with uncertainty.</p><p>Almost every president comes to Washington promising to cut the bureaucracy. Thus did Warren Harding, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George W Bush. The reality is that an activist president breeds bureaucrats. The power of the centre in a democracy attracts more power. Trump knows he has no time for a long fight. It is Musk and the chainsaw or it is nothing. Education is not a federal function but a job for the states. So shut theUS Department of Education. Ditto USAID. Also slash the state department. Raid the Treasury. Sure, things will get broken, but it is no worse than doing nothing. That is what cultural revolution means.</p><p>Trump and his administration’s actions have been in many respects appalling. To renege on Joe Biden’s aid to Ukraine in mid-battle, to call Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator, to insult Canada, to threaten Greenland, to stop famine relief to Africa, to propose a Gaza beach resort, to bully lawyers, toleak security meetings, all beggar belief. Trump and his team are like playground thugs in their crudity and rudeness.</p><p>But this is the sound of things breaking. It illustrates why Washington develops a defensive “swamp”, to guard against inexperienced presidents. As it is, the chance of Trump succeeding in his radicalism is small. You cannot stage much of a revolution in two years.</p><p>There will be a counter-revolution. Greenland is unlikely to be an American Ukraine. Tariffs will come back down. The Democrats will recover their nerve. Many of Trump’s “broken things” will be patched together. But in among the chaos are challenges to convention that were overdue. Nato could become realistic. A forever war in Ukraine – or wider – could be avoided and Russia readmitted to the community of nations, as China was after Nixon.</p><p>This is at least possible. More to the point, the US may review its role in the world, a role that has meant a quarter of a century of moral belligerence, with appalling cost and slaughter. It should revert to being what it is, another nation among nations. That may even be the result of someone moving fast and breaking things.</p><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist</p>

        <p>Investigation follows publication by Covid-19 inquiry of messages sent by Lord Chadlington introducing SG Recruitment to government</p><p>A Conservative peer who introduced a company he was involved in to the government to supply PPE is under investigation for the third time for potential breaches of the rules governing members’ conduct in theHouse of Lords.</p><p>The new investigation follows thepublication by the Covid-19 public inquiryof text messages and emails sent by Peter Gummer, whose peerage title is Lord Chadlington, introducing the company, SG Recruitment.</p><p>Chadlington sent a text regarding the company on 19 April 2020 to David Cameron, requesting help with advice on approaching the government.One week later, the small, loss-making nurse recruitment agency was awarded a£23.9m contract to supply coveralls. A month later during the pandemic, in May 2020, SG Recruitment was awarded a second contract,for £26.1m, to supply hand sanitiser.</p><p>The two contracts for a total of £50m were processed via the then Conservative government’s “VIP lane”, which gave high priority to companies introduced by people with political connections. Chadlington, a Tory peer since 1996, is a former adviser to Cameron and John Major when they were prime ministers. He had a financial interest in SG Recruitment – he was the chair, a paid director and a shareholder in the parent company, Sumner Group Holdings (SGH), registered in Jersey. The new messages show that Cameron referred Chadlington to another Tory peer, Andrew Feldman, a close friend of Cameron’s, who was advising the Department ofHealthand Social Care on PPE procurement.</p><p>Chadlington’s involvement in introducing SG Recruitment to Feldman was investigated twice previously by the House of Lords commissioner for standards, in 2022 and 2023, after reporting by the Guardian. The commissionercleared Chadlingtonboth times of breaking the rule that prohibits peers from seeking to profit from Lords membership by approaching ministers or officials in return for payment or financial incentive.</p><p>The new investigation will examine again if Chadlington broke that rule when introducing the company to the government, and another rule prohibiting peers from lobbying for companies in which they have a financial interest.</p><p>Chadlington told the Lords commissioner in writing in August 2023 that he did not “facilitate an introduction” of SG Recruitment’s majority owner, David Sumner, to Feldman.</p><p>However, in an email published by theCovid inquiry, and disclosed previously to the Guardian in response to a freedom of information request, it appears Chadlington directly introduced Feldman to Sumner.</p><p>“David,” Chadlington wrote, addressing Sumner, copying them both in. “This is my friend Andrew Feldman. He can help you with PPE we discussed this morning. Drop me off chain. Peter.”</p><p>The announcement of the third investigation states that the commissioner will also examine whether Chadlington has breached paragraph 9 of the Lords code of conduct, that: “Members of the House … should act always on their personal honour in the performance of their parliamentary duties and activities.”</p><p>The messages sent by Chadlington were published ina written submission to the inquiryby the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, a group of 7,000 families whose relatives died of the coronavirus. The inquiry is now examining the circumstances in which ministers and civil servants set up the VIP lane, and awarded its prioritised companies £3.8bn in contracts.</p><p>Sign up toHeadlines UK</p><p>Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>In its submission on SG Recruitment, the bereaved Covid families group said: “Members of the public are … entitled to form their own views as to whether the correspondence disclosed to the inquiry in relation to this contract is consistent with the accounts provided by Lord Chadlington elsewhere.”</p><p>Invited to comment by the Guardian, Chadlington’s lawyers said: “Given the investigation by the commissioner, and given the ongoing inquiry, it would not be appropriate for our client to provide any comment in response to your enquiries.”</p><p>They said that Chadlington’s position remains that the accounts he has previously given about his involvement are consistent with the messages he sent that have now been published.</p><p>The government has saidit is in disputewith SG Recruitment over the non-fulfilment of one of the PPE contracts. Despite the £50m deals, in December 2023 the company, which had been renamed,was put into liquidation, owing unpaid taxes to HMRC. The parent company went into liquidation in October 2022. Chadlington had resigned as a director in April 2021.</p>

    <h1>Jakob Ingebrigtsen’s father forced daughter to run with breathing problems, court told</h1>

        <p>The father of double Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen forced his daughter to keep running even though she was struggling to breathe after forgetting to take her asthma medication, a court has heard.</p><p>Ingrid Ingebrigtsen said that her father, Gjert – who coached her brothers Jakob, Henrik and Filip to international glory and became a TV star after the success of the documentary Team Ingebrigtsen – had scolded her during the incident, which occurred on a treadmill in the family’s basement.</p><p>“I ended up jumping off the treadmill, ran up to my room and breathed,” Ingrid told the court in Sandnes, Norway. “I tried to calm down. I expressed that I wanted to quit athletics.”</p><p>A few days later Ingrid, who is now 18, said she had broken down in tears in front of producers of the fly-on-the-wall series.</p><p>“They asked me a normal question, about the future of my career,” she added. “Then I saw no future. Then I broke down brutally. I couldn’t control it. They looked at me with their backs turned and were horrified. The interview ended.”</p><p>The documentary series is the most successful show in Norwegian TV history, but Ingrid told the court that it didn’t always reflect the reality of family life.</p><p>“I was five years old when the recording began,” she said. “This is something I grew up with and lived with, without having had a real choice myself. You could easily notice that something changed when a camera came along. I think they probably got a lot that wasn’t included.</p><p>“The entire series is not rigged, but certain situations and conversations could have been rigged,” she added. “We were placed in the kitchen and ‘now we’re going to talk about this’. But the conversations we had were real.”</p><p>According to the indictment, Gjert is alleged to have used threats, coercion and violence against his daughter, as well as restricted her freedom of movement.</p><p>Gjert, who is facing six years in jail for abusive behaviour towards Jakob and Ingrid, denies all allegations of violence.</p><p>On her second day of her evidence, Ingrid also told the court that her father had put his finger in her face and whipped her with a wet towel when she asked to go out with friends.</p><p>She said that the relationship with her father had broken down after she had decided to stop running the previous autumn, and that she had been forced to stay at home during her free time against her will.</p><p>“He could ignore me completely,” she said. “I felt like he was mad at me. And one day he said that he didn’t see me as his daughter any more.”</p><p>Asked about the incident in January 2022, Ingrid said she had pushed back when he refused to let her hang out with friends between 5pm and 6pm, only for him to put his finger in her face.</p><p>“I had felt trapped in my own home for so long,” she said. “I was pretty determined that today I would make it happen. I didn’t accept the ‘no’ I got from him.</p><p>“I had been so depressed and ignored for several months, I simply felt bullied. I pushed his finger away. To this day I don’t understand how I dared to do it, but I was probably pretty upset and angry.</p><p>“He had a small towel that he had been sweating in, so it was wet. He whipped it at my face. First once without hitting. Then he did it once more, and then he hit me on the cheek.”</p><p>Ingrid told the court that she then ran to the wife of her brother Henrik, who lived two doors away. Afterwards she said her father called her “many times and said that if I didn’t come, he would kind of come and get me”.</p><p>Under cross-examination, Ingrid was shown a series of text messages between her and her father in 2021, which she agreed showed that she had never asked for a day off from training before she quit running.</p><p>The court was also shown a text message from Gjert on 6 January 2022, after he was alleged to have hit her with the towel. “I apologise with all my heart,” it read. “I promise that I will never raise my voice against you again in my entire life.”</p><p>On Monday the court was shown a photograph of the mark on Ingrid’s face.</p><p>The incident led to Jakob and his two brothers ending their training relationship with Gjert and going public with their allegations. The trial, which is due to last until 16 May, continues.</p>

    <h1>It took an Oscar winner’s ordeal for the world to see the truth of settler violence. This is how to stop it</h1>

        <p>I have spent years fighting this reign of terror in the West Bank – and Hamdan Ballal’s treatment is typical of it</p><p>Imagine a group of a dozen armed men storming your village at nightfall. They assault you and your neighbours, throw stones at your house, beat you. If you try to defend yourself, or document the violence, they attack you. When the military arrive, they detain you. Some of themjoin inwith the violence. This harrowing scene is not a story from Tsarist Russia or Jim Crow America. Last Monday, this was exactly what occurred in the Palestinian village of Susya in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>The attackers who arrived in Susya were neither Cossacks nor Klansmen but Jewish-Israeli settlers accompanied by soldiers. Indeed, when the attacks commenced, three Palestinians were seized by the Israeli military, detained, and then subjected to police interrogation. Such violent raids are far from unique inWest Bank, especially in the areas of South Hebron Hills, Masafer Yatta and the Jordan river valley. Since the start of this year, the Centre for Jewish Non Violence has documented more than 40 violent settler attacks in the village of Susya alone.</p><p>Most go unnoticed by the rest of the world. But this time was different. One of the Palestinian victims was the award-winning director Hamdan Ballal, whose film,No Other Land,which covers the destruction of Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank, won best documentary at the recent Academy Awards. For hours, the military didn’t officially disclose his whereabouts, and attempts to locate him failed. When the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) finally issued a statement, theyabsurdly labelledhim and his fellow villagers terrorists.</p><p>This facade of justice, when law is nothing but an empty shell, is typical of how the Israeli occupation works. Under its veneer of legality, the most brutal savagery is legitimised and the role of criminal and victim inverted. In the past three years I have submitted numerous complaints to the Israeli Ministry of Defence and Israel’s attorney general about settler violence. Nothing has ever happened. My experience is only one of many that indicates how the Israeli legal system makes a farce of justice and allows settlers to terrorise Palestinian communities with impunity.</p><p>After the attack on Gaza began in 2023, the reign of terror in the West Bank has only intensified. According toB’Tselem(the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories), settlers have forced at least 18 Palestinian communities – more than 1,000 people – to flee their homes since October 2023. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has found that settler violence, intimidation and harassment havedisplaced at least 300 Palestinian households, including hundreds of children.</p><p>Benjamin Netanyahu’s government hasn’t just stood by passively and allowed this to happen. It has actively allocated funding and weaponry to illegal settlers. Last June, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data initiative (Acled) found that armed settlers, some of whom have formed their own quasi-military forces, had received a “considerable amount” of weapons and munitions, including thousands of pistols, M-16 semi-automatic rifles and machine guns from the Israeli military, while regional councils had coordinated with the IDF and the national security ministry to buy hundreds of additional rifles. As that report put it: “the lines between settlers and the military are increasingly blurring”, and “the difference between civilian aggressors and the Israeli state apparatus is fading even further”.</p><p>While civilian security squads are supposed to act only in self-defence, the truth remains that Israel is unwilling to tackle those vicious gangs, and that senior government ministers advocate in their favour. Only last week, Israel’s security cabinet approved a plan to recognise 13 Jewish settlements in the West Bank as independent. “We continue to lead a revolution of normalisation and regulation in the settlements. Instead of hiding and apologising – we raise the flag, build and settle,” said theIsraeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.</p><p>The atrocity that happened in Susya is only one example of the countless injustices committed under this criminal occupation. It shouldn’t take an Oscar winner for international audiences to notice these acts of violence. The Palestinian people deserve safety and liberation from the occupation, and sovereignty and independence. The international community must play its part in pursuing this. In recent months,a numberof governmentshave issued sanctions against Israeli settlers. This is a good start, but these sanctions must be far stronger if they are to have an effect.</p><p>The sanctions should include established illegal settler municipalities. Those imposed by the UK, for example, only targetthree illegal settler outposts and four organisationsthat have supported the settlers. The established municipalities, such as Shomron regional council, which oversees 35 settlements that are home to an estimated 47,200 people, are the driving force behind violent attempts to take control of more Palestinian territories. Personal sanctions against government ministers who block counter-terrorist measures against violent settler groups are also essential. The UK can play a leading role in coordinating this response, particularly given the moral depravity of Donald Trump’s administration. As Washington DC cancels sanctions against violent settlers, London could present the world with a different and more righteous path.</p><p>When I arrived in Susya on Tuesday after the attack, I knew exactly what I wanted to tell its people. I said that we want to live together, Arabs and Jews, as brothers and sisters. That we are not the enemy of one another, as we struggle together for freedom. A mere day after a gang of criminal Israeli settlers terrorised this village, its villagers welcomed me,an Israeli member of the Knesset, and my message for peace. This proves that the real conflict is not between nations, but between those who seek justice and those who vow bloodshed. The government of Israel has chosen the path of bloodshed, ethnic cleansing and war. It is up to all of us – and to you – to choose a different path.</p><p>Dr Ofer Cassif is a member of the Knesset, representing the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality (Hadash) since 2019</p><p>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    <h1>EU appears to back down on carbon levy on international shipping</h1>

        <p>Bloc set to accept compromise that would allow companies to trade carbon credits, in blow to climate finance</p><p>The long-awaited carbon levy on international shipping that was to supply vital climate finance looks set to be significantly diluted, after the EU appeared to be backing down in global talks, in a blow to vulnerable countries.</p><p>The EU is set to accept a compromise that would allow companies to enter into a system of trading carbon credits instead of paying directly for their emissions, the Guardian has learned.</p><p>Campaigners and experts said the move would mean less money for therescue and rehabilitationof countries stricken by climate disaster and made it less likely that shipping companies would move quickly to decarbonise their fleets.</p><p>“This compromise fundamentally ignores the needs of some of the most vulnerable countries,” said Tristan Smith, associate professor in energy and transport at University College London. “There is a better compromise available.”</p><p>Accordingto the International Energy Agency(IEA), the shipping industry produces about 2.2% of global CO2 emissions. Forcing shipowners to pay a small charge for every tonne of carbon dioxide their vessels produce has been touted as a key way to raise some of the hundreds of billions of dollars needed for climate finance.</p><p>A proposal for such a levy, which has the support of scores of developing countries, the EU and the UK, is under discussion at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London, in talks that started last month and resume next week before finishing on 11 April.</p><p>But the levyfaces fierce oppositionfrom China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and about a dozen other countries that have strong interests in exports or fossil fuels, and argue that it would raise prices for consumers. Some members have argued that a majority vote could push through the levy, but China has made it clear it would not accept such an outcome and has threatened to effectively withdraw from the IMO if the issue was forced.</p><p>Arsenio Dominguez, the secretary general of the IMO, does not want to enforce a majority vote if it can be avoided. “We work on consensus, that’s always the focus of the IMO,” he told the Guardian. “During adoption of the rules, member states can express their concerns, they can express their support to one proposal or another. My objective is always to work with the member states to get an agreement, a consensus approach, and if there are any concerns raised during that consensus approach, to continue to work on that, to address it. But to keep the house together.”</p><p>The EU, which held an emergency meeting on the issue on Thursday, will still formally state its preference for a simple levy. But the Guardian understands that the bloc will concede key ground by falling back on a compromise proposal involving carbon trading, tabled by Singapore, provided that it aims to raise as much cash as a levy would.</p><p>Analysis by Smith and other experts suggests the Singapore proposal would provide perverse incentives for shipowners to use short-term solutions to cut their carbon, such as heavy investment in biofuels, rather than seek long-term solutions in the form ofnew fuels, such as ammonia.</p><p>“Carbon trading is uncertain and volatile, and not investable,” said Smith. “It will not result in more investment for long-term technologies.”</p><p>Biofuels are often environmentally unsustainable, as they compete with food crops for scarce agricultural land.</p><p>Sign up toDown to Earth</p><p>The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>Another compromise proposal that has been tabled by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and has the backing of a large proportion of the industry, would, Smith said, be preferable to the Singapore plan. Ships would pay a charge for their carbon output, but it would be more flexible than a levy, would represent a single flat fee and, because it would fall under technical regulations on fuel standards, would not face problems with adoption by countries such as the US that require legislative approval for taxes.</p><p>Proponents of the ICS plan, including some developing countries, argue it should be acceptable to China, Brazil and their allies, because it uses a standard for fuels that they have already agreed to and starts at a low cost that can be scaled up later.</p><p>Andrew Forrest, the Australian mining billionaire turnedgreen advocate, who is investing in hydrogen-powered ships, had harsh words for those who seek consensus. “I challenge anyone who advocates for a consensus, because they’re not actually advocating for a consensus, they are a wolf in sheep’s clothing intending to hold the status quo of fossil fuel and accelerate the pollution of our environment and the inefficiency of our shipping industry,” he told the Guardian.</p><p>Friederike Roder, the director of theGlobal Solidarity Levies Task Force, said: “In two weeks’ time, we could have theworld’s first international levyon shipping emissions. This would be a milestone in our efforts to raise climate finance, hold polluters to account and support the global south. We need a strong agreement which delivers climate ambition and decarbonisation for the shipping sector, while shielding the most vulnerable economies.”</p>

        <p>Ellie Kildunne will win her 50th cap for England when she starts against Wales at the Principality Stadium in the Women’s Six Nations on Saturday as one of 13 changes to the starting XV.Kildunne, who made her England debut in 2017 and has scored 36 tries for her country, will start at full-back after making an appearance off the bench on the wing inEngland’s 38-5 win over Italylast Sunday.</p><p>“She is outstanding, she is the girl that everyone is looking up to at the moment,” said England’s forwards coach, Louis Deacon. “She is such an exciting player. To achieve 50 games for the Red Roses is an outstanding achievement but she has got so many more games to come down the line as well.”The wings Abby Dow and Jess Breach will round off the back three either side of Kildunne while Megan Jones and Tatyana Heard feature for the first time this tournament in the centre partnership with Zoe Harrison and Natasha Hunt the half-back pair.In the front row Mackenzie Carson, Lark Atkin-Davies and Sarah Bern start. Morwenna Talling and Abbie Ward come into the second row with Sadia Kabeya starting at openside flanker. The only two players to keep their positions in the XV are the captain, Zoe Aldcroft, and the No 8 Maddie Feaunati, who had a player of the match performance against Italy. Abi Burton, who can play across the back row, is in line to win her first cap from the bench.The vast amount of changes comes as the head coach, John Mitchell, is testing out different combinations during the Six Nations with the World Cup in mind.</p><p>Deacon said when asked if consistency is hard to achieve with so many changes: “To be honest we have trained with both combinations for the last few weeks. So it is not like we need a huge amount of cohesion, it has always been the plan to go with two combinations for the first two games.</p><p>“From a training perspective they have spent a lot of time together. A game is very different and pressures are different but we have prepared well this week so I don’t see it being an issue.”</p><p></p><p>Wales: J Joyce-Butchers; Neumann, H Jones (captain), Powell, Cox; George, Bevan; G Pyrs, Phillips, Scoble, Fleming, Crabb, Williams, Lewis, Evans.</p><p>Replacements: K Jones, Maisie Davies, Rose, A Pyrs, King, Meg Davies, Keight, Metcalfe</p><p></p><p>England:Kildunne; Dow, Jones, Heard, Breach; Harrison, Hunt; Carson, Atkin-Davies, Bern, Talling, Ward, Aldcroft (captain), Kabeya, Feaunati</p><p>Replacements: Cokayne, Botterman, Muir, Galligan, Burton, L Packer, Aitchison, Rowland</p><p>Wales have made two changes to their starting team aftera 24-21 loss to Scotlandlast Saturday. The prop Gwenllian Pyrs comes in as well as Gwen Crabb in the second row. The No 8 Georgia Evans, who received a red card against Scotland, starts as she is free to play after facing a disciplinary committee.The game at the Principality will break the record for a women’s sporting event in Wales with more than 18,000 tickets sold. The previous record was held by the Wales women’s football team with 16,845 watching their European Championship playoff in November against the Republic of Ireland.The Wales head coach, Sean Lynn, said: “The prospect of playing in front of a record rugby crowd at the home of Welsh rugby is recognition of the growth in the women’s game. The players have been told to be brave and to believe in their ability to compete at the highest level.”</p>

    <h1>Who is Jeffrey Goldberg, the journalist who broke the Signal leak scandal?</h1>

        <p>Atlantic editor-in-chief added to a White House group chat discussing strike plans has history of serving in the Israeli military – and angering Trump</p><p>Though exactly how Jeffrey Goldberg ended up on aSignal group chatto discuss what were meant to be secret plans to bomb Yemen remains a mystery, posterity may render it one of recent US history’s most serendipitous chance encounters.</p><p>Had the fates been conspiring to add a journalist to the forum whose presence would inflict the maximum discomfort to Trump and his circle, they could hardly have chosen a more fitting candidate.</p><p>Goldberg, editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, was already considered a bete noire by circles aroundDonald Trumpeven before Monday’s embarrassing revelation that he had been accidentally added to a chat that included the US defense secretary, the White House national security adviser and the heads of the country’s intelligence community.</p><p>At the same time Goldberg is also widely criticized by some on the left of US media and politics for his views onIsrael, his past record serving in the Israeli military and his hawkish views on Iran and his support for the US invasion of Iraq.</p><p>However, since becoming the Atlantic’s editor-in-chief in 2016, he has built a track record of unearthing stories that have managed to specifically get under Trump’s skin with the type of journalism loathed by the president’s “Make America Great Again” (Maga) followers. That, coupled with seemingly acute embarrassment over the sensitivity of his disclosures, helps explain the animus displayed towards Goldberg by multipleadministrationofficials and surrogates.</p><p>Mike Waltz, the national security adviser who assembled the group chat to discuss the military operation, called Goldberg “a loser”, “the bottom scum of journalists” and insinuated that he may have tricked his way into the group, in a Tuesdayinterview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News.</p><p>Remarkably, given the personal antipathy, Waltz insisted that he did not know Goldberg, adding insinuatingly: “I wouldn’t know him if I saw him in a police lineup.”</p><p>The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, labelled Goldberg a “deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who has made a profession of peddling hoaxes”.</p><p>The ad-hominem attacks appeared to be orchestrated and aimed at discrediting the source of a story that threatened to puncture the air of invincibility that surrounded Trump’s first two months back in the White House.</p><p>It is hardly the first time that the US president and members of Trump’s circle have attacked Goldberg for work that has deeply angered them. In fact, he and his magazine have a lengthy record of publishing such pieces.</p><p>During last year’s presidential election campaign, Trump reacted furiously to an Atlantic article written by Goldberg that cited John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff, as describing how Trump wanted to have military generals who would be personally loyal in the same way he believed German commanders had served Hitler.</p><p>Trump already harbored grievances about an earlier Goldberg piece from 2020, also sourced to Kelly, in which he was said to have disdained dead US military servicemen buried in a French cemetery as “suckers and losers”.</p><p>Trump vehemently denied the allegations, even after Kelly told Goldberg: “There are many, many people who have heard him say these things.”</p><p>Compounding the rightwing hostility is the reputation Goldberg gained asBarack Obama’s go-to interviewer.</p><p>Obama granted Goldberg five interviews over the course of his presidency that were widely praised as authoritative by Washington insiders.</p><p>While Goldberg’s invitation to the Trump group chat remains unexplained, there is something fitting in it being related to the Middle East and Israel, which has been on the receiving end of missiles fired by the Iran-backed Yemeni Houthis that were the target of the US strikes being decided on.</p><p>Born in Brooklyn to Jewish parents, Goldberg, 59, studied at the University of Pennsylvania,but left before graduatingto move to Israel. He joined the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), serving as a guard at a prison that held Palestinians detainees during the first intifada of the late 1980s and early 1990s. In hismemoir he describedwitnessing the beatings of detainees.</p><p>His Israeli connections, have resulted in some eye-catching stories. These included an Atlantic cover story in 2010 – based on sources in the upper echelons of the country’s military and intelligence community – that predicted that Israel would strike Iran’s nuclear facilities within a year to stop Tehran’s Islamic regime acquiring a bomb.</p><p>No attack subsequently happened but the article’s impact may have spurred the Obama administration into intensifying pressure on Tehran to negotiate limits to its nuclear programme, which eventually led to a deal in 2015 that Trump later renounced.</p><p>Despite his pro-Israel sympathies, Goldberg gained a reputation among some fellow journalists for bravery for being prepared to interview Islamists classified as terrorists by western governments.</p><p>Twoarticlesin the New Yorker in 2002, entitled In the Party of God, explored the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah, and were based on face-to-face interviews conducted in the Bekaa valley.</p><p>But he also drew criticism over another New Yorker piece in the same year, which suggested that Saddam Hussein posed a significant threat to the US with weapons of mass destruction that were subsequently never found after the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq.</p><p>The accusation of having made the case for invading Iraq has been cited this week by Goldberg’s present-day pro-Trump critics as part of the effort to discredit him.</p><p>But some of Goldberg’s peers say his talents and courage as a journalist and editor have been on clear display in the most recent scandal as the magazine navigates incredibly tricky national security turf and a hostile administration desperate to keep it quiet.</p><p>“As is pretty clear in his Atlantic article, he doesn’t give away any top secret information, anything that would endanger the participants,” said Jay Tolson, editor of a cultural review magazine at the University of Virginia and a cohort of Goldberg’s when they were both covering religion and politics in Washington in the early 2000s.</p><p>“He’s a very brave guy, and, you know, eager to tell the truth.”</p>

        <p>It was a morning from hell for the chancellor. After the spring statement and Trump’s overnight tariffs, time for a kicking</p><p>That screeching noise you can hear? It might just be the government trying to avoid making contact with reality.</p><p>You know the saying. Go to sleep on it. Things will look better in the morning. Well, that didn’t quite work out forRachel Reeves. She went to bed on Wednesday with everyone from all sides of the political spectrum giving her a hard time for the spring statement that definitely wasn’t an emergency budget. Because an emergency budget would suggest that something had gone wrong in the last six months. And Rachel was certain that everything was tickety-boo.</p><p>If anything, the world looked even bleaker for Reeves on Thursday morning. First thing she did was check her phone. She quickly wished she hadn’t. If anything, the newspaper headlines were even more brutal than the day before. Rachel closed her eyes. Wishing she could melt away. Wishing she could restart the day in an alternative reality.</p><p>This wasn’t how she had ever imagined herself as chancellor. She had wanted to be the woman who grew the economy. Who saved the nation’s finances. Instead, all she got was a kicking. She wasn’t used to failure. And this was before she had made the entirely pointless journey to a Cardiff building site for a series of hostile interviews with the media. She didn’t know if she was feeling ready for yet another punishment beating.</p><p>The BBC’s Nick Robinson was in no mood for taking prisoners on the Today programme. What had gone so wrong that she had been forced into making benefit cuts? You could hear the defensiveness in Reeves’s voice as she cut into auto-pilot. Trying to stick to the set script her advisers had prepared for any hostile questions. Everything was more or less normal, she said. Just tinkering round the edges. Global headwinds. Sticking to the fiscal rules. Look on the bright side. There was no longer a £22bn black hole and the changes to the welfare system were long overdue. Would that do?</p><p>It wouldn’t. Robinson chose to remind her of her changes to national insurance at the previous budget. That had definitely been a budget. What had that done to business confidence? Had that contributed to the growth forecasts being downgraded by 50%? Rachel decided to answer a different question. NHS waiting lists were down. Why did everyone ignore all the wonderful things she had achieved?</p><p>We then got down to the specifics of the benefit cuts. Nick played a tape of a man with brain injuries who was having his allowance cut by £900 a month and would soon be homeless. Was this what a Labour government was elected to do? Reeves sounded desperate. As if she realised she was cornered. Just in front of her she could see one of her team gesturing to slit his throat.</p><p>“I want to make everyone richer,” Rachel said. The denial was cutting in big time. “Everyone is going to be £500 richer.” The disabled people didn’t know how lucky they were to be made to work even if they couldn’t. Robinson suddenly realised the chancellor might he having a major meltdown. She didn’t seem to understand that the whole point of making benefits cuts was to save money. Just saying that everyone would suddenly have jobs that would make them richer was a fantasy. In any case, the Resolution Foundation had calculated that those on the lowest incomes would be £500 worse off.</p><p>Moving on. What about Donald Trump and the overnight car tariffs? Now the desperation turned to something close to panic. Nick had dared to mention He Who Cannot Be Named. She crossed herself as a precaution. No one in government was allowed to say anything that might offend the Sun-Bed God. Trump was to be praised for his great wisdom at all times. He could do no wrong. Even when he moved in mysterious ways.</p><p>“Um,” said Reeves. “We don’t have a trade surplus with the US.” Fingers crossed that everything will be OK. Intense negotiations with the greatest president who had ever lived. Nick’s mouth open and closed. It was dawning on him that the UK had a chancellor who wasn’t aware there was an Orange Lunatic in the White House. Someone who really didn’t give a shit about the UK. Who only might take notice if American cars were threatened with the same tariff. The UK is now officially a supplicant at the court of King Donald.</p><p>Time to bring the interview to a close. Robinson suggested that we could all be back in the same place in six months’ time. The fiscal headroom again vanishing beneath the combined effects of Trump, Putin and the government’s own policies. This was too much for Reeves. Doing all this all over again? No. It was going to be fine. Something good would happen. The Office for Budget Responsibility had forecast nearly 2% growth in five years’ time. Nick didn’t have the heart to tell her the OBR was often wrong and that 2% was nothing to get excited about.</p><p>It was much the same on LBC, where Nick Ferrari seemed so concerned for the chancellor’s wellbeing that he went relatively easy on her. Up to a point. He didn’t avoid the tough questions but he allowed her non-answers to hang. The listeners could draw their own conclusions. It was the most polite of roughing ups. He started with her own words. Last June she had promised to be the most pro-growth chancellor ever. Now look at us. What had gone wrong?</p><p>Ferrari covered much the same ground on cuts and tax as Robinson. The best that Reeves could manage was that she wasn’t Kwasi Kwarteng. Or Jeremy Hunt for that matter. Be thankful for small mercies. He ended by asking about the free tickets to the theatre and Sabrina Carpenter concert. Rachel was caught in the headlights. Unable to explain why she hadn’t offered to pay the going rate for top-price tickets. These things aren’t hard. Especially when you were caught up in a freebie scandal only a few months earlier. No one had ever said she shouldn’t receive preferential treatment. Just pay for it.</p><p>The media ordeal ended with Rachel appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain. Even here, she didn’t come away unscathed as Kate Garraway and Richard Madeley, not usually the fiercest of interviewers, piled in. How did she feel about making disabled people’s lives so much worse? Reeves didn’t feel very much. That was her defence mechanism. Her means of survival. Battered. Bruised. Looking no further than to get out of the morning still in one piece. One day at a time. Just for today.</p>

        <p>It looked destined to take over the world. But after misfiring albums, a legal drama involving bright hopes NewJeans and with domestic fans getting bored, the South Korean music industry is nervous</p><p>Earlier this decade, it seemed as if the long-vaunted South Korean takeover of American pop was finally happening. In summer 2020, BTS’s Dynamite became the first K-pop track to top the US chart, and in 2023, girl group Blackpink became the first K-pop act toheadline Coachella. But just two years later, the story looks very different.</p><p>RubyandAlter Ego, recent solo albums by Blackpink members Jennie and Lisa, each debuted at No 7 on the US album chart before dropping out of the Top 10 after one week, and neither album produced a single that peaked higher than No 68. Relative newcomers such as Tomorrow X Together, Ateez and Twice have achieved solid first-week chart positions, thanks to strong physical album sales, before facing precipitous drop-offs. NewJeans – a young, critically acclaimed new K-pop group who looked to be the genre’s strongest hope in the US after Blackpink and BTS – have been bogged down by controversies and legal dramas in South Korea, stopping them from capitalising on the success of their 2023 single Super Shy.</p><p>Even back home the genre is struggling. “K-pop has lost a lot of market traction in South Korea – the music is not being written to appeal to a Korean audience, but more to this homogenised, globalised audience,” says Sarah, the host of the Idol Cast podcast, who uses a pseudonym for fear of reprisal from K-pop fans. “It’s trying to be all things to all people, and ends up being sort of nothing to no one.”</p><p>Sarah says thatK-popmade by obsessed-over “idols” – performers hot-housed in training camps by entertainment agencies – is no longer seen as cool in trend-conscious South Korea. “A lot of older fans have entered the fandom, including older women. I’m not bashing them, I’m one myself,” she says, but these newcomers have alienated young would-be fans. K-pop has also, she says, “become a lot more siloed” away from the rest of South Korean culture. “You’re not seeing idols in TV dramas or variety shows; a lot of content is moving on to gated [online] platforms like Weverse.”</p><p>This shift coincides, says US reporter Tamar Herman, with a move away from Korean lyrics. “It’s built to be exported,” she says. “Because of Dynamite’s success as an all-English song, K-pop started leaning into English.”</p><p>This also alienated Korean listeners – while more innovative acts such as Le Sserafim and Aespa, without the forceful marketing push thatBTSand Blackpink received, haven’t found a footing in the US market. “The US loves to invest attention into certain artists – once you have it, you become the [sole] representative of [K-pop],” says Herman. “We don’t care for the hottest thing – we want the artists we’ve followed since high school, like Taylor Swift.”</p><p>The UK has only fitfully embraced K-pop, though there’s enough of a fandom for Tomorrow X Together to play London’s huge O2 Arena this week, and for Stray Kids to book two nights at Tottenham Hotspur’s stadium in the summer. But artists like these, Sarah says, could be losing traction in South Korea because they have “pivoted their focus from the domestic market to the global K-pop market”. The South Korean charts are filled out instead with J-pop acts, Korean rap and “2D idols” like Plave, a virtual boyband. Meanwhile, Bang Bang Bang, a 2015 hit by boyband BigBang, “has consistently been one of the most-streamed K-pop songs globally over the past few months, which is not great for K-pop,” Sarah says. “Where are the new songs?”</p><p>In the US, one of the few genuine hits by a K-pop star in recent months has beenAPT, by another Blackpink member, Rosé. But it sounds nothing like K-pop, instead taking its cues from pop-punk and new wave, and is a collaboration with the eternally popular Bruno Mars. “Take him out of the song and I doubt it’s nearly as successful,” says Joshua Minsoo Kim, a critic who reviewed Jennie and Lisa’s albums for Pitchfork.</p><p>“[Rosé] has done everything she can to separate herself from the brand of K-pop,” says Sarah. “She’s even moved her copyrights to an American company – so that should speak to her confidence in the South Korean industry to handle an actual global hit song.”The teen five-piece NewJeans were one of the biggest success stories in K-pop’s western expansion. Their breakout EP, Get Up, featured collaborations with the alt-R&B singer-songwriter Erika De Casier and experimental Norwegian duo Smerz, and their innovative sound found acclaim among fans and critics. “[Producer] Min Hee-jin’s creative direction was very strong,” says Kim, and the music “was often produced by Korean producers privy to stuff happening in the underground and internationally”.</p><p>Here was an act that actually felt cool to gen Z and younger millennials – but over the past year, NewJeans have been stuck in a bitter war with Hybe, the K-pop company that formed them. The group attempted to terminate their contract with Ador, the Hybe subsidiary that formed them in 2022, alleging mismanagement. The group were also angry over the fact that Min Hee-jin was dismissed as Ador’s chief executive. Ador subsequently sued NewJeans, alleging that the band had no grounds to terminate their contract – though in February the label stated they “regret the escalation of this matter to court and believe that most claims advanced by NewJeans members thus far have arisen from misunderstandings”.</p><p>The band are the rare K-pop act to break ranks from the genre’s rigid corporate system; last year, they aired a bombshell livestream in which they spoke directly to fans about their perceived mistreatment. The spat has since bloomed into a media storm, fuelling discussions around the rights of K-pop stars as workers,a status they have been legally denied.</p><p>The potential ramifications are grave – a coalition of trade bodies warned in February that the spat could “collapse” the K-pop industry – and NewJeans have continued to act as whistleblowers. This month, member Danielle said that when she was a trainee in one of the idol boot camps, she was constantly surveilled and had to have all meals approved by management (Ador and Hybe have not commented on those allegations).</p><p>Last week, a South Korean court ruled infavour of Ador, granting a preliminary injunction that will stop NewJeans from working outside their Ador contract until the main lawsuit hearing in April – they had recently been performing as NJZ. Ador has said that it is “fully committed to supporting the artists going forward” so long as they perform as NewJeans; the band, posting as NJZ, have said they can “no longer remain with a management that has disrespected our identities and undermined our achievements”. They are now on hiatus and planning to challenge the injunction, saying in a statement to Time magazine: “It almost feels like Korea wants to turn us into revolutionaries.”</p><p>Kim is pessimistic about a new K-pop group breaking the genre’s losing streak in the west, and Sarah says K-pop companies have started milking fanbases more intensely than before to make up for the decline in new artists breaking, with fees to access elements like fanclubs and exclusive videos. “At a certain point, the audience becomes tapped out: you can only pay so much for your hobby, especially looking at a recession coming around the corner,” she says. “You can’t ask fans to sustain this multimillion-dollar industry. It’s a losing strategy in the end.”</p><p>But Herman still believes there is great K-pop going untapped in the US – “certain groups who are huge in other parts of the world”, such as girl group Twice, “arguably the biggest K-pop girl group of this generation, if you look at money and album sales. I don’t know if they’re going to cross over or not, but I’m here for everything.”</p>

        <p>Ministers urged to do more after United Utilities discharged raw sewage into Unesco site for 6,327 hours last year</p><p>Celebrated by William Wordsworth, Windermere has long epitomised the natural timeless beauty of theLake District, with millions of tourists drawn to the shores that inspired the poet. But today England’s biggest lake is, some campaigners say, a shadow of its 19th century self: its waters blighted by algae and its wildlife threatened by pollution, in a symbol of all that is wrong with the privatised water industry.</p><p>This month the environment secretary, Steve Reed, vowed to break with the recent past, standing on its shores andpromising that Labour would “clean up Windermere”. The lake is showing the impact of sewage pollution from United Utilities treatment plants and increased pressure from climate change-induced temperature rises.</p><p>Reed’s promise was welcomed as a historic moment by Matt Staniek,a campaignerwho has almost singlehandedly brought the lake’s plight to national consciousness. But Staniek, who formed the group Save Windermere, added that it was just the beginning of the mission to save the lake.</p><p>He said he wanted to see an end to sewage releases into Windermere, something that has been achieved elsewhere in the world, including at Lake Annecy andLake Geneva.</p><p>The difficulty of that mission was exposed byofficial figures released by the Environment Agencyon Thursday. Windermere, they reveal, was the dumping ground for 6,327 hours of raw sewage discharges from six United Utilities treatment works in 2024.</p><p>Guardian analysis of the past five years of raw sewage releases reveals more than 32,000 hours of untreated effluent has been discharged into the Unesco world heritage site.</p><p>The lake is almost entirely enclosed, its waters moving so slowly that a single drop of water takes nine months to go from the north side of Windermere to the south. It is also subject to dischargesfrom 1,900 private septic tanks and from agricultural runoff, but the sewage pollution is considered the most significant contributor of phosphorous entering the lake, causing more frequent intense algal blooms, which reduce dissolved oxygen levels and harm water quality and aquatic life,in some cases driving them to extinction.</p><p>In 2022 a category one incident, the most serious, led to a mass fish killin Cunsey Beck, a site of special scientific interest, which feeds into Windermere.</p><p>Four years after he began his campaign, Staniek has succeeded in putting its plight at the top of the environment secretary’s inbox. But raw sewage is still pouring into the lake.</p><p>“Today’s data release reveals the true extent of the exploitation of England’s largest lake,” he said. “The nation is watching what is happening to the people’s lake, and they want to see it protected – both for now and for future generations. We want to see a legally binding commitment that will eliminate sewage discharges into Windermere once and for all. We want ambition to be turned into action.”</p><p>Sign up toDown to Earth</p><p>The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>United Utilities said Thursday’s data showed a 28% reduction – 2,460 fewer hours – of raw sewage discharges into Windermere.</p><p>The company pointed to the commissioning last August of an additional 2.6m litres of storage at Ambleside and Windermere wastewater treatment plants; the equivalent of just over an Olympic-sized swimming pool.</p><p>Matt Hemmings, the chief operating officer at United Utilities, said: “We are committed to playing our part in improving the water quality in the Windermere catchment. We’re already on with delivering £200m of investment to ensure we treat wastewater to even higher standards alongside significantly reducing discharges from the six storm overflows that discharge into the lake.</p><p>“The government’s announcement looks at a long-term plan for only rainfall entering Windermere and we will be working with the other partners involved to support this.”</p>

        <p>Less use of gas and coal in electricity supply and industry sectors drove reduction, Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says</p><p>The UK’s carbon emissions fell by 4% last year, according to official figures.</p><p>Provisional statistics published on Thursday by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) show UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions were 371m tonnes carbon equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2024, down from 385 MtCO2e in 2023.</p><p>Emissions were 54% lower than they were in 1990, DESNZ said.</p><p>Greenpeace UK’s policy director, Doug Parr, gave a guarded welcome to the announcement. “This good news is the latest demonstration that the UK’s efforts to tackle climate change are working, despite what some politicians on the right might try and make you believe,” he said.</p><p>He noted though that while emissions were falling, the UK was still dependent on “expensive and polluting gas” for energy.</p><p>“This is driving up the cost of household energy bills, controlling the price of electricity and leaving us beholden to gas-exporting countries who may not have our best interests at heart,” he said.</p><p>“The government must put a stop to the great gas rip-off, and rapidly make renewables the backbone of our energy system to lower our bills for good.”</p><p>DESNZ said “decreased gas and coal use in the electricity supply and industry sectors” had driven the fall in emissions, with electricity supply emissions down 15% and industrial emissions down 9%.</p><p>The closure of the UK’s last coal-fired power station in Septemberandan expansion in renewable energy played a significant role, officials said, as did higher electricity imports and the winding down of blast furnaces for the steel industry.</p><p>The largest source of emissions continued to be the transport sector, which accounted for 30% of the total, but a fall in the use of diesel-powered cars on the UK’s roads led to a 2% fall, according to the statistics.</p><p>Emissions from the buildings and product use sector – the second most significant, accounting for 21% of the total – rose by 2% “due to higher gas use likely driven by an easing of energy and other cost pressures”, according to officials.</p><p>Ironically, climate change may also have contributed to the fall. “Above average temperatures and fewer heating degree days since 2022 has kept residential buildings emissions down relative to earlier years,” the statistical release said. “If weather conditions for both 2023 and 2024 had followed long-term trends, there would have been a 4% increase in residential buildings emissions estimates.”</p><p>The estimates cover seven gases which contribute to a “greenhouse effect” in the earth’s atmosphere – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride. CO2 made up about 78% of the 2024 total.</p><p>DESNZ has been contacted for comment.</p>

    <h1>Nothing for Gavin & Stacey? The sheer number of omissions in the TV Baftas is ridiculous</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

        <p>From the Barry-Billericay finale, to Wolf Hall, Pachinko and Nobody Wants This, there are far too many cruelly overlooked shows this year. But the even bigger problem? Bafta’s Adolescence issue</p><p>Stalking saga Baby Reindeer leads 2025 TV Bafta nominations</p><p>The latest Bafta TV awards again show the range of talent across UK television. Though drama characteristically dominates, the shows with most nominations – Rivals, Mr Bates vs The Post Office, Slow Horses and Baby Reindeer – represent a range of genres and source material (from real events via a 36-year-old Jilly Cooper bonkbuster to a solo theatre show) suggesting that the 2025 voters have largely avoided historical snobbery, long a problem in these prizes.</p><p>The awards also continue a belated honouring of overlooked talent. After improbably having to wait until last year for his first main Bafta nomination, David Tennant gets a rapid second, for his thrilling turn as a Richard III of the TV industry in the raunchy Cooper adaptation Rivals.</p><p>It also seems rudely overdue that performers as great as Jonathan Pryce and Sharon D Clarke have had to wait until now: honoured for Slow Horses and Mr Loverman respectively. Danny Dyer also makes his debut in the lists, though oddly not for his career-transforming wigged romantic in Rivals but for Sky Max’s Mr Bigstuff.</p><p>As always, we have our own regretted omissions. James Corden and Ruth Jones, for Gavin & Stacey: The Finale, feel cruelly overlooked in the scripted comedy section, as does Peter Straughan in the scripted drama category for Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, a masterclass in the distillation of the 883 pages of Hilary Mantel’s novel into punchy dialogue that sounded plausibly 16th century while still comprehensible now.</p><p>And in an international category with only six places, the number of omissions is becoming ridiculous. Although some shows made by streamers (Rivals, Slow Horses, Supacell) are judged British enough to compete in the main categories, the chosen international half-dozen – including Shōgun, After the Party and Colin from Accounts – crowds out Pachinko, Nobody Wants This and Disclaimer.</p><p>In awards covering the first political cycle since 1964 that UK and US elections have fallen in the same year, there will be some concern in journalism departments at the lack of recognition, although the director of the BBC election night gets a craft nod.</p><p>Although the BBC remains the leading nom-magnet – with 49 nods in the television awards and 26 in the parallel craft awards – its director general and chairman may be alarmed at an apparent vertiginous tilt in the industry’s balance of power.</p><p>The oldest British broadcaster’s almost half-century in the main television awards is well beaten by the 69 for other broadcasters, with Channel 4 (18) and ITV (15) having very strong years – the former helped by great comedy and current affairs, the latter by its dramas, Mr Bates and Until I Kill You – and the streamers growing in power.</p><p>Most alarming for the corporation, ahead of renegotiations of its Royal Charter and funding system from 2027, is that 26 nominations are shared by shows that fulfil a key BBC remit – drama about contemporary Britain – and yet were not made by the BBC: Mr Bates (ITV), Baby Reindeer (Netflix), Slow Horses (Apple TV+) and Rivals (Disney+).</p><p>There can be some sympathy for the BBC excuse that it doesn’t have the money: the awards ceremony on 11 May will take place in the context of warnings that British TV production and careers are becoming unsustainable due to pressure on budgets from streamer competition and UK tax breaks originally intended to help the industry. (Now renamed “expenditure credits”, these benefits can favour big budget projects that are more likely to be made by foreign broadcasters.)</p><p>Even so, with Adolescence – another British story made with Netflix money – currently setting ratings records, candidates applying to replace the departing Charlotte Moore as BBC Chief Content Officer must surely be asked at interview: should you/would you/could you have made at the BBC Adolescence, Mr Bates, Baby Reindeer, Rivals and Slow Horses. And if not, what is the point of the BBC drama department?</p><p>An Adolescence issue for Bafta is that, weirdly, this is the second year running that there is a sense of a deafening television conversation elsewhere: a TV drama that everyone is talking about but has to wait a year for Bafta recognition. Because the qualifying period is the previous calendar 12 months, Mr Bates vs the Post Office (premiered 1 January 2024) is only honoured now, 15 months later. And Netflix’s Adolescence (dropped 13 March this year) will only come into contention this time next year.</p><p>Academy voters have been happy to wait to vote for Mr Bates, although as at this week’s RoyalTelevisionSociety awards – where the Post Office drama won no trophies despite nominations – the show may suffer in voting rooms from a sense of being so early last year.</p><p>It’s probably impractical to change the Bafta nominations window so shows that really want the gold mask on their shelves should arrange winter or autumn transmission: Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light (BBC One, from 10 November) and Rivals (mid-October) may have benefitted from transmission close to the filling in of ballots. (Disclosure: I am a Bafta voter, though with no insider knowledge of the voting process.)</p><p>Another issue for the organisers is that while best soap clearly doesn’t have enough contenders – it is now effectively a matter of choosing three from four, with Hollyoaks missing out – the international category clearly has too many, calling either for more international categories or further redefinition between “domestic” content (the five terrestrial networks plus Sky) and “international”, a category invented to contain (in every sense) the streamers but which is stretched by the growing number of British stories they tell.</p><p>Next year, Adolescence will surely have to be classified as British and will surely sweep the awards, continuing the sense that, for purely logistical reasons, Bafta is a year off the pace.</p>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Now I understand the terminology, it all seems so clear</p><p>Inever identified as shy as a child because my younger brother was the type of kid who wouldn’t speak in the company of strangers, and I – apparently – never stopped talking. Shyness was comparative, and, in my family of origin, there was always someone shyer than me.</p><p>I didn’t notice my shyness until I split with my first long-term partner when I was 26. He’d been my boyfriend from the age of 14, so – by the time we parted – almost half my life. This first boyfriend was gregarious, always ready for a chat. He had a way of walking into a room and cracking a joke, so by the time I entered on his tailwind, everyone was already laughing. He’d warmed the room and I’d felt welcome. I’d never been an adult without him, so didn’t have any awareness of how he’d held me under his wing.</p><p>In the aftermath of our split, I became conscious of how difficult I found certain aspects of socialising. Simple things like how to enter and exit a room. Beginnings and endings: how to start a chat and how to finish one. How to mingle in a crowd of people. Parties or gatherings of any sort suddenly became fraught.</p><p>I’d always assumed my ex-partner was simplyfriendlybut, in 2013, a decade after our split, I readSusan Cain’s, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talkingand realised he wasan extrovertand I wasan introvert. According to Cain, shyness and introversion often cross over but they aren’t the same thing.</p><p>Extroversion and introversion exist along a spectrum but they are mostly viewed as traits we’re born with rather than develop. It seemed odd that I had to get to 36 to learn this about myself. My chattiness one-on-one had worked as a distraction. In fact, I found bigger groups overwhelming and needed lots of alone time to recharge. Like the shyness, my obvious introversion took some time to become obvious to me.</p><p>My granddaughter came in to this world so vivacious that her extroversion was impossible to miss. Even from before she was mobile, she was throwing her arms up in welcome and squealing with delight at the sight of a visitor. Everything displayed, everything shared. She’s so friendly out in public that I often come up against my own shyness when I carry her around. When she started talking, she’d motion to someone in the queue ahead and say – “I shy” – but what she meant was,I would like to connect with that person and I’m not sure how.</p><p>Striking up conversations with strangers is not my forte but she seemed to want my help. She was not yet two but she was already pushing me out of my comfort zone. One day, while I was wheeling her along the main street of my country town, an unknown woman called out, “Hey, party girl!” This was clearly not aimed at me and I had to laugh. My granddaughter’s social networks were already larger than mine and she was still in nappies.</p><p>What is a shy person to do with such gregariousness?</p><p>My eldest son, her father, had been the same. Throughout his life I’d watched him making enthusiastic small talk with strangers. As a teen he’d start up chats with elderly people at the checkout, spying dogfood in their trolleys and asking what type of dog they had. Often, they’d brace at first – the dissonance of this friendliness with his teenage attire – but a few minutes in and they’d be smiling. When he was young, before I’d read Cain’s book, I’d tried to force rest days on him to catch up from the kind of socialising that left me drained. He never seemed to need it but I did.</p><p>On these home days all his games involved imaginary “parties”. I found his outgoingness baffling; he wondered why I was always so tired. When my second born came on the scene, dreamy and internal, he made perfect sense. He cried when I took him out in the world, all that overwhelming sound and colour. He nestled into me, staying close. As a toddler, his favourite game was snuggling on the couch. Our needs in perfect sync.</p><p>In my family, introvert-extrovert pairings are common. Both my sons have paired up with their opposites. Now I understand the terminology, it all seems so clear! My introvert son’s partner once declared, “I hate having a shower, it’s so boring!” and I realised it was the only time she ever spent alone. I watch them all navigate their differing needs: the introverts enjoying recharging in quiet, the extroverts wanting chats in the shower.</p><p>My granddaughter is now just past two but she can talk up a storm. I was out with her a few weeks back and we bumped into a friend I hadn’t seen for years. I was immediately awkward but my granddaughter came to my aid. “You have a blue dress!” she said to my friend, “and mine is pink!” The ice was broken. It was a beginning. I was holding my granddaughter on my hip but she had me under her wing.</p><p>My younger son and his partner have a fifteen-week-old baby. A new granddaughter! Thus far, she’s expressive and smiley. My older son’s partner gave birth last week. A grandson! In this genetic lottery, I wonder what we’ll get. Introverts who’ll snuggle on the couch, or extroverts who’ll help us make new friends. I cannot wait to see!</p><p>Jessie Coleis the author of four books, including the memoirs Staying and Desire, A Reckoning</p>

        <p>The Oscar winner answers your questions about playing everyone from Peter Sellers to the Marquis de Sade, his home town of Toowoomba and new care-home horror The Rule of Jenny Pen</p><p>The Rule of Jenny Penlooks terrifying! Does the prospect of sudden ageing frighten you?BenderRodriguezIt’s not sudden. I was in [King] Lear when I was 64 and said: “I need a wig that’s grey because he’s supposed to be 80.” Now I’m 73 and I still think inside I’m a brunette. This is the 54th year of my career. The last decade has just galloped past. I waited for something like this – a project that I latched on to. There’s been a lot of stuff that I turned down. I’m now being very pernickety about what I commit three or four months of my life to.</p><p>No doubt there was also a lot of work behind it, but was playingHector Barbossain the Pirates of the Caribbean filmsas much fun as it looked? Have you everreinhabitedthe character for a brief moment, to amuse yourself or others?Liam01Yeah, it was fun. [Director] Gore Verbinski had a kind of pop cultural sense of anarchy. Anyone who liked the Pirates films should also check out Rango, which has his cinematic fingerprints all over it. I’ve reinhabited the character for brief moments, for the Disney ride in Anaheim, and I think Shanghai, and maybe in Florida. I remember having to go and voice some lines after a day on another film, and rolling my eyes going: “Oh my God, will this never go away?” It’s the vanity of being a moment of cinema folklore. It’s fun.</p><p>Have you had much experience of care homes?BenderRodriguezMy mum died in 2022, quite sweetly on Valentine’s Day, which was very moving. She’d been in a care home for about three or four years. The last year there was a noticeable decline. She was in her 90s. My mother-in-law, also. So, yes, once you turn 60, the time is coming up for you to thank your carers.</p><p>How did it feel having a Nobelprize winner playing your conscience? (Harold PinterinThe Tailor of Panama.)UrrurrshIt was three of the greatest days of my life. He was a hero to me when I was studying English theatre in the late 60s in Brisbane. And suddenly he was there. They’d done a painting of Harold in a three-piece, blue pencil-stripe suit with a tailor’s measure around his neck. He came in, a little sweaty and a little prickly, and he saw that painting and tears just welled in his eyes. He said: “My father worked in the East End as a tailor, like many Jewish émigrés did. So I find that overwhelmingly powerful.”</p><p>Pinter told me that when he got his first royalty cheque for The Homecoming, he went down and said: “Dad, you’re coming home and you don’t need to come back here any more.”</p><p>You’ve played a lot of real-life characters includingTrotskyand nowGroucho Marx. How does your approach to these roles differfrom fictional characters?hubbahubba,Haider3, WomanofWolfvilleI have played a number of what people would sniff their noses at and call biopics. And we all know that, for some biopics in commercial Hollywood, you’re gonna get the Wikipedia tropes. With Elizabeth, the director Shekhar Kapur – being a man from India – never spoke to me like he was from the RSC. He just spoke about Krishna. He spoke about Elizabeth and Walsingham as being like gods: mythical as well as big political figures. So that’s always been a useful way to go. Even playing Einstein [inGenius] or Trotsky [in Frida], you’ve got to find what’s inside that character that has some kind of contemporary relevance you can portray without denying the historical context.</p><p>Quills (2000)is a favourite and your performance was superb. What was it like working withPhilip Kaufman?BicuserI went into a meeting with Philip to say that I couldn’t possibly do the part and that Marlon Brando should do it, because in 1808, the Marquis de Sade was 300lb and I’m not.</p><p>I learned a great lesson from that because he said: “No, the Marquis that Doug has written is the fantasy in the Marquis’ head. It’s as if he’s the hero of the story: a wry, lithe, elegant, muscular god in his own attic.”</p><p>I very much enjoyedThe Best Offerin which you andDonald Sutherlandwere both excellent. It should have been a bigger success. Any other films you’ve done which deserved more than they got?pconlFilms get what they deserve. I would’ve liked The Warrior’s Way, originally called Laundry Warrior – which I thought was a much more kitsch and honest title – to have done better. It was struck down by the big financial crisis in 2008. The fact that the lead character was a baby, too, didn’t help. I thought they’d written a fantastic eastern western where what was at stake was the survival of the baby who was the last of the clashing clans. I thought it could have gone gangbusters, but yeah, not so much.</p><p>What memories do you have ofToowoomba?DidgebabaWhen I was eight, my single mum and my sister and I went to live with my grandparents there. It was kind of artistic wasteland in regional Australia. But it also wasn’t.</p><p>George Sorlie had created this travelling variety troupe which had been picked up again by his widow and a great clown, Bobby Le Brun. By night, they would do a variety show with jugglers and dancers and songs and speciality acts. And then by day, that whole troupe would do a panto.</p><p>These people were deeply rooted in the smell of sawdust, the greasepaint, putting the tent up. There was also the Toowoomba Philharmonic Society, which gave me a lifelong love of Broadway musicals because their production in 1959 of Oklahoma is still deeply etched into my psyche.</p><p>Lantanais one of my favourite neo-noirs. Is noir an Aussie genre, or is can-do, sunny optimism more in line with the national psyche?StevefromNottinghamI’m always surprised that’s the film the gen Z audience knows me for.</p><p>Both pessimism and optimism happen. When I did Shakespeare in Love, the young guys were all staunchly regional and proud of it, no longer the generation who had to crush their regional dialect into PR. They were proudly scousers or northerners. But they could do their stuff. Every afternoon we’d watch Neighbours and they were all really great at what they thought was a fantastic Australian accent. And I said: “No, that’s a television Australian accent. No one exists that actually speaks like that. It’s much more nuanced.”I think that is the sunny can-do image of Australia. There’s a cultural reality to theTen Pound Poms. But Australia also has films likeWake in FrightandNitram, the film that Justin Kurzel did about the Port Arthur massacre. We come from a country that has a lot of skeletons in the closet, a lot of regrets, a lot of difficulties, from white settlement onwards. The good film-makers don’t shy away from that. I think that’s why our boisterous, rough-edged sardonic sense of humour can be quite biting and quite satirical. A way of acknowledging that we’re just not surf culture.</p><p>Was John Lithgow as scary as he looked [in Jenny Pen] and how do you rate his Aussie accent?BenderRodriguezYes! The first conversation we had on a Zoom he said: “I’ve got this guy to make some special teeth.” And I went: “You’re my kind of actor.” He’s got aDe Palmadegree in horror acting. And he had silver-grey contacts made and said: “The moment I put them in, the character was 98% there.”</p><p>I did tell him to beware the New Zealand accent. It’s a trap for English-speaking people. Kate Winslet is the only person I know who has the kind of dialect chops to do it. Her impression of Jane Campion was forensic in its detail. John and I talked about what one of my voice tutors used to call having an “idiolect”, which is the distinct sound of your voice. And John went for something nasty and dry and deceptive and duplicitous, just in the nature of the character.</p><p>What is your favourite Peter Sellers film? After preparing for your great performance as him [in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers], would you agree with his very sad assessment that outsidehis roles, he had no real sense of his own identity?Bauhaus66I was so lucky. I was in LA doing Pirates and at the end of Sunset Boulevard there were a lot of extraordinary DVD and VHS shops. We found pretty much every Peter Sellers film. So I did watch everything. He was blessed with a kind of extraordinary genius. But with success and fame and drugs and swinging London and everything, you have to confront a lot of stuff. I think that happened to him.</p><p>I don’t care that Caravaggio murdered people. I don’t mind that Ripley murders people, because I thought Andrew Scott made that characterso alarmingly truethat I sort of hoped he got away with it. A lot of what was going on around him was privileged and he’s going: “Fuck off! You are dead, east coast rich people!”</p><p>You’ve portrayedLionel Logue(inThe King’s Speech),Donovan Donaly(Intolerable Cruelty),Hans Hubermann(The Book Thief),Sir Andrew Aguecheek(Twelfth Night), and even voicedBunyip Bluegum(The Magic Pudding). Is it purely coincidental, or are you secretly drawn to alliterative characters?VerulamiumParkRangerThis made me actually go through my IMDb list, and my theatrical list, to see if they’d missed anything. I avidly read Superman comics as a child and I was obsessed by the LL syndrome: Lois Lane, Lana Lang, Lex Luther. I found that kind of phenomenal when I was 10 as I did when I read Ulysses inShakespeare and Company, where I was fortunate enough to blag a room for six weeks when I first moved to Paris.I have played a “Harry” more times than any other character – in The Tailor of Panama, The Banger Sisters, in some short film. I’ve been ‘Harried’. Michael Caine has the same thing. Caine would only ever call Joaquin Phoenix “Joe-a-quin”; “You read it, Geoffrey,” he’d say. “And it’s notRafeFiennes, it’s Ralph.” He was hilarious like that.</p><p>Kia ora!What attracts you to roles first – the story or the character? I love your performance inHouse on Haunted Hill,even though it’shardly Proust. You seem to have a whale of a time, though, and that comes through every scene.WilfyFrederickI never assumed it was Proust. I liked the fact that it was a William Malone horror piece, avoiding CGI, with all of the old William Castle techniques to create a netherworld and creepy scenarios. I’d been in tights or period costume for so long and I thought: this is the ideal role to do because, as one of the producers – Robert Zemeckis or Joel Silver – said: “It’s low budget. We’ll make it for $15m and it will do two bumper weekends for Halloween.” Which it did; it made $40m. So they were like: “Hey, we just made $25m. Let’s move on to the next chapter.” There was something nice about that.</p><p>When you get home and are not working, what do you do for entertainment?AwightmateMy obsession apart from Superman and vaudeville is the Mercury Seven [astronauts] and the James Webb telescope. I’m intrigued that it’s now however many million miles at a certain point in orbit around the sun, so that it can be at the right temperature. And that they ingeniously had to develop this massive shield which is made up of hexagons. And that was all folded up mathematically, like a chrysalis, like a moth in a cocoon. And it went up into space and then it opened itself and we’re now seeing stuff in the dark.</p><p>I’m just completely obsessed by the otherness of what’s out there. Everyone says one day they’ll suddenly go: “There’s been definite communication with beings or creatures or overdeveloped insects that went into a different direction. They’re making contact with us.” The magnitude of it all! But that may not even happen. It may have happened millions of years ago and come and gone.</p><p>So just be happy that we actually evolved on this bit of rock and became relatively sophisticated. But notthatsophisticated, because this is probably the worst time the planet’s ever really been through. There’s an edge, and in Jenny Pen audiences tap into that. What would it be like to be in that home in the last chapter of your life, to know that there’s really no hope?</p><p>I also like dogs and cryptic crosswords. I have a greyhound and a regular series of generational pugs. The one we’ve got at the moment is nearing her end. The look in her eyes is becoming bewildered and lost and I tell her: “You’re a honey.”</p><p>The Rule of Jenny Pen is in UK and Irish cinemas now, and on digital platforms from 28 March</p>

        <p>There’s no need to buy a new phone every year: make yours last with these accessories, and tips on maximising the battery and storage</p><p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.</p><p>Modern smartphones have reached a plateau. Each new release makes only small gains, rendering frequent upgrades to new models a waste of time and money.</p><p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.</p><p>The good news is that smartphones now last a long time: look after yours properly and it could last seven years or more. Here’s how to make your phone go the distance.</p><p>The most frequent fate of a phone is a smashed screen or damaged back. Drops happen, but a good-quality case with proper impact protection can prevent them from becoming an expensive mistake. Most manufacturers make cases for their phones, but beefier cases are available from companies such asOtterBox,SpigenandSpeck. More sustainably minded options include biodegradable cases, including those made byWave CaseandPela. Also, consider fitting a goodstrengthened-glass screen protector, which will stop your screen from getting scratched and help prevent cracks.</p><p>Defender phone case</p><p>From £12.99 at OtterBoxScreen protectors</p><p>From £4.97 at Carphone WarehouseFrom £19.99 at Belkin</p><p>A phone grip can help you keep hold of even the largest of devices. There are many options, including the ever-popularPopsockets, which are essentially pop-out knobs you stick to the back of a phone with magnets or adhesive. Alternatives includephone ringsandloops and hooks, though you could also consider gettinga case with a lanyardto put over your wrist or around your neck or a cross-body phone strap.</p><p>Cross-body phone strap</p><p>From £33 at CasetifyFrom £33 at AmazonPopGrips</p><p>From £2.99 at EtsyFrom £10.99 at Popsockets</p><p>New versions of your phone’s operating system bring two things: added functionality and crucial security updates. Given that most whiz-bang features on new models are now software-based, you can often get them for your existing phone simply by updating to the latest Android or iOS and keeping your apps up to date. More importantly, these updates will keep your phone protected against security threats to help prevent criminals from stealing your data. When your phone stops getting security updates, you should stop using it.</p><p>Most phones come with a decent amount of storage, but they can fill up over the years with photos, videos, music, apps and the general detritus of modern life. Make sure you have at least 2GB to 5GB of free storage at all times to help keep your phone running quickly.</p><p>Regularly clear out blurry or duplicate photos and unneeded screenshots. Store your photos and videos in the cloud: there are plenty of providers to choose from, such asApple’s iCloud,Google Photos,Amazon PhotosandMicrosoft’s OneDrive. Delete unused apps and games. Remove old music, films and TV shows that have been downloaded for offline playback. Empty your downloads folder and clear out your messaging storage, particularly if you’re part of WhatsApp group chats, as every image, gif or video sent quickly adds up.</p><p>Batteries are consumables that wear down every time you charge them until they need replacing, so it’s important to plan for a battery replacement after a few years of use. Most modern smartphone batteries last about 500 to 1,000 full charge cycles. Each charge cycle is cumulative, so if you use 60% of the battery one day, recharge it and then use 40% the following day before recharging it, that is one full charge cycle.</p><p>There are things you can do to help extend the life of the battery. Avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures, which accelerate ageing. Using your phone less means fewer recharges, so frequent use of the battery-saver mode, setting a short screen timeout and other power-saving settings can help.</p><p>Changing the way you charge it can make a big difference, too. Batteries have to work harder in the first and last 20% of capacity, causing more degradation of their internal components than the middle bit. Keeping a battery mostly between 20% and 80% of its maximum charge will significantly reduce its wear over time.</p><p>Both Android and iOS devices have long been able to learn from your charging habits and charge the battery to 100% only just before you need it, such as an hour before you wake up. But you can also now limit the maximum charge to 80% on many devices.</p><p>ForiPhone 15and later, look in Battery Charge settings. ForAndroid devices, including Samsung, Pixel and OnePlus, look in settings under battery protection, charging optimisation or battery health, depending on the manufacturer.</p><p>Cleaning your phone screen withantibacterial sprayfrom time to time is a good idea, but don’t forget to also clear out the various holes in the sides of your phone. Keep the charging port clear of pocket fluff to stop it from becoming blocked, and watch out for the buildup of detritus in the speaker and mic holes. If you don’t routinely play music out loud, it’s worth cranking the phone’s volume up to maximum with a loud and aggressive track every so often to eject built-up dust, particularly from the earpiece speaker.</p><p>Antibacterial phone spray</p><p>From £1 at Muc-OffAntiviral phone wipes</p><p>£1.25 at Wilko£1.25 at The Range</p><p>Samuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor</p>

    <h1>These games were indie smash hits – but what happened next?</h1>

        <p>The developers of Thank Goodness You’re Here!, Frog Detective and Consume Me discuss burnout, ‘second-album syndrome’, erotic fan art, and the other highs and lows of having a breakout success</p><p>It is now more or less impossible to put a precise figure on the number of video games released each year. According todata publishedby the digital store Steam, almost 19,000 titles were released in 2024 – and that’s just on one platform. Hundreds more arrived on consoles and smartphones. In some ways this is the positive sign of a vibrant industry, but how on earth does a new project get noticed? When Triple A titles with multimillion dollar marketing budgets are finding it hard to gain attention (disappointing sales have been reported for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the Final Fantasy VII remakes and EA Sports FC), what chance is there for a small team to break out?</p><p>And yet it does happen. Last year’s surprise hit Balatro has shifted more than 5m copies. Complex medieval strategy title Manor Lords sold 1m copies during its launch weekend. But what awaits a small developer after they achieve success? And what does success even mean in a continuously evolving industry?</p><p>James Carbutt and Will Todd of Coal Supper are still trying to make sense of it. Their acerbic satireThank Goodness You’re Here!, in which players slap their way through bizarre quotidian scenarios in the fictional humble northern town of Barnsworth, is now an award-winning game. “It’s just not registered as a success in my head at all,” says Carbutt. “The numbers are going up on screen, and there have been YouTube playthroughs and some erotic fan art. Beyond that, it won’t register.”</p><p>After spending three years working on the project, the pair now find themselves in the confusing glare of the spotlight, fielding questions about what’s next. “It’s horrible,” Carbutt jokes. “But I don’t think we feel any sort of second-album syndrome. The space it gives you to be a bit introspective about what you want to do next is the interesting quirk of a successful indie game.”</p><p>Veteran indie developer Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out,Baby Steps) offered them sage wisdom. “He spoke about how you should focus not just on making something good – because how do you quantify that, it’s amorphous?” says Todd. “Instead we should look at what it is we want to explore and judge success intrinsically, based on whether we explored that thing. The pressure of speed to market doesn’t apply to us, because it’s never going to be possible to crank something out in six months to chase success anyway. It’s more like, in the wake of this being received well, what’s the next thing we want to explore? That’s something we’re interrogating at the moment.”</p><p>Australian developer Grace Bruxner has also redefined success after leaving behind a trilogy of Frog Detective games: bite-size adventures co-developed with Thomas Bowker that quickly became cult indie hits.</p><p>“Success in games has always been a bit of a lie, a bit of an illusion,” she says, pointing to typical markers such as cultural impact, player numbers and financial gain. “My measure of success is: did I make something I’m proud of, and has it impacted my life and other people’s lives in a positive way? And yes, it did, so thumbs up.”</p><p>Bruxner began working on the series during her final year at university as an experiment, to see whether she could produce a commercial game. After a relatively breezy first outing, the second Frog Detective game demanded that Bruxner and Bowker lock in, and spend most of their time on the project. By the third instalment, the hard work had paid off, though the pressure had begun to take its toll. Throw in the pandemic, as well as mental and physical health issues, and Bruxner was ready to take a break. “I wasn’t grinding super hard, but I also wasn’t having a great time,” she says. “It just was really nice to make that choice to stop.”</p><p>Sign up toPushing Buttons</p><p>Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>Bruxner still has game ideas swirling in the back of her head, but she wanted to escape the endless production cycle that has swallowed up many of her peers, regardless of mounting exhaustion or burnout. “It’s not universal advice,” she says, “but if you’re a solo dev or a really small team, I don’t think there’s any shame in leaving it there. Unless you love making games. I’m not sure I love making games. I was quite young when we released the first Frog Detective, so it was like, ‘This is my entire identity for life. I don’t know how to be a separate person from that.”</p><p>Three years after the series’ swan song, she is on indefinite hiatus, exploring alternative creative paths – such as pottery. “I can’t imagine making games, because of the expectations on me as a creator,” she explains. “I don’t even know where I would go from here.”</p><p>Bruxner has been surprised by her ability to sustain herself on the modest amount of money provided by Frog Detective. “If your game continues to have a tail, and you can budget properly and live within your means, it is possible to have a passive income that isn’t tied to being a horrible landlord,” she explains. Even so, she knows how taboo it can be to talk plainly about money, especially in creative circles like the indie game scene. “I have the free time to chill and decide what I want to do, but I assume at some point I’ll probably need to have a career again. My biggest question is will this money last forever? Probably not, and then what happens when it runs out? I don’t know.”</p><p>It may seem as though more indies than ever have broken into the spotlight in recent years. But enduring games industry turbulence has made finding financial support for follow-ups and debuts more complicated. “The elephant in the room is everything that’s happened over the past couple of years, with mass layoffs, studio closures and evaporating funding opportunities,” explains AP Thomson, a developer of the forthcoming indie Consume Me with fellow NYU Game Center graduate Jenny Jiao Hsia. “Before that, there was a pretty major change around the mid-2010s when indie publishers and funders started rising in prominence. Everything we’ve heard suggests that the same opportunities no longer exist or are incredibly limited.”</p><p>Consume Me, the duo’s coming-of-age scheduling RPG doesn’t have a release date but has already been nominated for five gongs at the IndependentGamesFestival awards. As such, Jiao Hsia and Thomson are already under pressure to decide their next endeavour. “Multiple people have told us we should be moving forward once it launches,” says Thomson.</p><p>Even with growing expectations, the pair aren’t keen to get ahead of themselves. “Everything we’ve heard suggests that now is really not a great time to be pitching, so we’re going to focus our energy on the launch and then read the temperature of the room after that,” Thomson adds.</p><p>“I’m looking forward to finding enjoyment in making art again, instead of feeling like I have to show up to a job I never applied to,” explains Jiao Hsia. “The idea of making art for fun, without worrying about making money off it, is something I can’t wait to do.”</p>

        <p>Final gathering in April will mark end of street protests although campaign to continue ‘in courts and prisons’</p><p>Supporters of the climate groupJust Stop Oilhave announced that, after three years of disruptive protests, they are ending their campaign of civil resistance.</p><p>Hannah Hunt, whose speech on Valentine’s Day 2022 marked the beginning of the campaign, made the announcement outside Downing Street inLondonon Thursday.</p><p>“Three years after bursting on the scene in a blaze of orange, at the end of April the Just Stop Oil campaign will be hanging up the hi-vis,” she said.</p><p>“Just Stop Oil’s demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history. We’ve made fossil-fuel licensing front page news and kept over 4.4bn barrels of oil in the ground, while courts have ruled new oil and gas unlawful.</p><p>“But it’s time to change. We are heading for 2C of global heating in the coming decade, resulting in billions being killed, mass civil unrest and social collapse. Meanwhile, we are seeing corporations and billionaires buying political power and using it to punch down on the weak and the vulnerable.”</p><p>Hunt said the group was creating a new strategy to tackle current realities but that “nothing short of a revolution is going to protect us from the coming storms”.</p><p>A source within Just Stop Oil said the campaign would continue taking actions until a final protest in Parliament Square on 26 April. After that, the campaign would continue to exist “in the courts and in the prisons”, but not on the streets. Any new protest movement devised by supporters would appear under a new banner with a new strategy.</p><p>Just Stop Oil said in a statement: “Just Stop Oil was intended to be a campaign to prove the effectiveness of disruptive tactics in bringing about necessary change, and we have been incredibly successful in that aim, but it’s now time to change.”</p><p>Will McCallum, the co-director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Just Stop Oil paid a heavy price for raising their voices at a time when politicians and corporations are trying to silence peaceful protesters – in the streets and in the courts. We must not allow our hard-won right to protest to be stripped away, because it is the right that all other rights depend upon.</p><p>“Greenpeace and many others will continue to defend this proud tradition of taking action on issues that matter to make change possible.”</p><p>Sign up toDown to Earth</p><p>The planet's most important stories.

In particular, new offences of interfering with key national infrastructure, “locking on” and tunnelling, and a revision of the law around causing a public nuisance, have been used to criminalise climate activists and sentence them to long jail terms.</p><p>Dozens of protesters have been jailed.

    <h1>There are more child amputees in Gaza than anywhere else in the world. What can the future hold for them?</h1>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Tens of thousands of children have been wounded in Gaza. Even those evacuated for treatment face an impossible path</p><p>When I entered the home in north-east Philadelphia, Elias, a lively four-year-old boy, grabbed the pack of KitKats I had brought with me and began swinging it over his head. He whirled around in circles, hollering something unintelligible. In a familiar scene – I have small children of my own – his mother tried to impose order, but yielded to the greater force of a kid on sugar kept indoors by a cold snap.</p><p>Elias, his five-year-old sister Taline and nine-year-old brother Khaled were in the US because Elias and Taline needed urgent medical care. They had sustained staggering injuries when an Israeli pilot or drone operator shot a missile at the house they were taking refuge in. The explosion cleaved Elias’s right leg off below the knee. Taline’s injuries were also severe; she arrived in the US with external fixators – pins and steel in her legs – as she battled infection. A program organized and managed byHeal Palestine, a non-profit that helps evacuate wounded children from Gaza, arranged the children’s travel with their mother, Amna.</p><p>When we met, Taline shied away from me, withdrawing into a large sofa. She peeked out from behind copious bangs while I talked with a volunteer from the organization, which had secured housing for the family for the duration of their stay in the US. Once the children’s treatment is completed, perhaps by the summer, their mother said, the family will have to leave the US for Egypt, a stipulation of the state department.</p><p>Their father, Amna’s husband, was still trapped in Gaza – he hoped to join the family in Egypt whenever the Rafah border reopens, now a distant possibility with Israel resuming its assault. In Egypt, their rights and access to education will be limited. The Egyptian government has indicated that Palestinians who have taken refuge in the country will have to return to Gaza, an uncertain prospect even beforeDonald Trumppronounced his intention to cleanse the territory of Palestinians. The question of what the children’s futures would be like – what kind of future was possible – cast a long shadow over our time together.</p><p>Taline was unable to walk well – her doctors in the US had tried to repair her legs hoping to avoid amputation, which remains a possibility. Elias had been fitted with a prosthesis, enabling him to move around the home. He was boisterous, and when I played back a recording of my conversation with his mother, Amna, his voice – his shouts and laughter – acted as counterpoint to the horrors Amna was describing.</p><p>Khaled, the nine-year-old, was different. He had been trapped with his father in Gaza’s al-Shifa hospital for three days during Israel’s second siege of the facility in March 2024; Taline and Elias had already been evacuated south to Rafah with Amna by that time. Khaled watched as Israeli troops killed people at the hospital. He watched, too, when his father was beaten, stripped and dragged off to the beach, where he was interrogated for two days. Israeli troops bulldozed the nearby cemetery, and when Khaled was compelled to leave on the third day of the siege, he picked his way, with all the other surviving women and children, through a field of corpses.</p><p>He was, his mother told me, suffering from emotional issues.</p><p>I had sought the family out – and others like them – to begin to piece together what had happened to the children of Gaza. Before October 2023, kids accounted for roughly half of the 2 million Palestinians there. Official figures put the death toll in Gaza at more than 50,000 people,a number that continues to climb as Israel renews its attacks. But a study in the Lancet estimates that Israeli troops killed more than64,000people in just the first nine months of their rampage, the time for which the study’s authors had data. In other words, the official count is probably dramatically understated.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UN reports that at least14,500 childrenhave been killed – also probably a dramatic undercount. The real mortality figure is probably unknowable, not least because somany familieshave been killed at once, leaving no one to account for some babies or toddlers ever having existed.</p><p>Beyond the mass death, international agencies suggest that at least110,000 people in Gazahave been injured, including at least25,000 children. And Unicefestimatesthat between 3,000 and 4,000 children in Gaza have had one or more limbs amputated. That small tract of earth is now home to more child amputees per inhabitant than anywhere else in the world.</p><p>Much of what these kids are experiencing is hidden from the world – journalists still cannot enter Gaza, and many of those who called the place homehave been killed. Yet, a handful of children have made it out for treatment, in the US and elsewhere.</p><p>In the United States a life-changing injury doesn’t mean the end of a life worth living. Laws are in place to ensure people with disabilities enjoy equal rights and opportunities. For those with insurance, there is advanced medical infrastructure with follow-up care.</p><p>But what does an amputation mean in a place with no sidewalks, no streets or wheelchair ramps or prosthetists? What promise can the future hold for children who have sustained brain injuries, or burns that destroy their ability to maneuver or function? What kinds of outcomes will exist for children who have no access to psychologists, physical therapists, legal rights – or homes?</p><p>The many thousands of injured children are important. Yet together, their bodies tell a story, one that has been embossed for all time on the terrain of the 21st century. They act as the prism through which questions of international law and the protection of the vulnerable will be mediated. But if the loss these children have endured is a judgment, it is also prologue. Because their needs, their capacities and limitations, will define the contours of Palestinian society and memory forever.</p><p>Amna seemed wary of me initially. But as she spoke the words came more freely.</p><p>She had survived multiple Israeli wars on Gaza, and had lived through an 18-year siege. Then came the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, and Israel’s devastating response.</p><p>Before then, Amna recalled, life was hard, but home “was my heaven, too”. She was pregnant when the assault on Gaza began, and she delivered Faris by cesarean section on 11 December 2023.</p><p>Ten days later, an Israeli pilot fired a missile at her apartment building. In past wars, her neighborhood in Jabalia had been spared. “The area where we were was supposed to be safe,” Amna told me.</p><p>Amna, Khaled and Taline sustained deep cuts in that first assault, and required stitches – in Taline’s case, to close lacerations on her arm and head. A neighbor provided the address of a nurse who lived nearby. The family fled the rubble and made their way to her home.</p><p>“We got to the house. It was overflowing with displaced people. I can’t tell you how many. There were so many people,” Amna said.</p><p>The nurse stitched the open wounds on Taline’s arm and head. She explained that the laceration in Taline’s arm was deep and would require internal stitches, something she was unable to do. She also told Amna that the little girl’s arm was broken.</p><p>The entire time, the bombing continued. Soon after the nurse finished treating Taline, a second explosive struck, killing 11 people at the nurse’s home.</p><p>“The walls disappeared. You can’t see anything. You swallow the dust. You can’t hear anything,” Amna recalled.</p><p>“My first shock came when I saw [Faris]. He was in my arms. He was choking. I thought he was dead. But he hadn’t died. Someone took him from me and shook him and he began to scream. My baby who died. He was alive then.”</p><p>Skin is the body’s largest organ, made of fat and protein. The top layer, the epidermis, is where melanin is formed and where new skin cells are made. Humans wear new skin – the whole is renewed – every month. But not in the case of injury, particularly one caused by fire.</p><p>The Cleveland Clinic offers aguideto burn injuries. First-degree burns are what we experience after touching a hot kettle. The damage caused by the heat is superficial, and the skin recovers quickly. Second-degree burns mean the “top and middle” layers of the skin are damaged. The next degree of severity – third-degree burns – touches the third layer of skin and thin layer of fat just beneath it.</p><p>A fourth-degree burn goes into the muscle and gristle, the nerves. Muscle is roasted by the fifth degree. Sixth-degree burns scorch bone.</p><p>In Gaza, the extraordinary incidence of amputations is explained not only by the traumatic force injuries caused by relentless Israeli bombardment, but burns and resulting infections as well. Many amputations should not have been necessary.</p><p>Dr Feroze Sidhwa, speaking from Gaza, said that he saw many children lose limbs that could have been saved under other circumstances. He cited the destructiveness of the weapons, the high rates of infection given the sanitary conditions at hospitals, the scarcity of necessary medical equipment, and malnutrition as leading contributors to amputation.</p><p>“It’s very difficult to heal a wound when you have no protein intake for a week, let alone for 15 months,” he said</p><p>Dr Thaer Ahmad, another doctor who operated in Gaza, explained that treating burns requires a lot of resources that were often unavailable. In ordinary circumstances, he said, a physician may be willing to tolerate an infection that results from a burn, since infections can typically be treated.</p><p>“But given the pressure that’s being put on the health system and practitioners in Gaza, an amputation is a relatively quick treatment than can be done,” he said.</p><p>We may never learn how many children had treatable wounds that, in different circumstances, may have resulted in their keeping a limb.</p><p>Baylasan was 11 when her house was bombed in Khan Younis. We met in a suburb of Washington DC in December 2024, near where she was receiving treatment.</p><p>“I’m afraid of loud noises,” she said.</p><p>She told me about the first nights of the war in Gaza, in October 2023. A missile exploded nearby one evening: “I woke up and started screaming. My mother came to comfort me. I was afraid; I was shaking.”</p><p>The night of her injury, in November of 2023, her mother had made her a cheese sandwich before bed.</p><p>“At nine or 10 I went to sleep – I didn’t feel anything until 2am. I heard Mama screaming under the rubble. I didn’t know I was under the rubble.”</p><p>She lost consciousness and awoke four days later in the hospital, unaware that her leg had been amputated.</p><p>“Every time someone would sit by my leg I would scream thinking they would injure it.”</p><p>Baylasan – vivacious, funny and sarcastic – stood out when we spoke. She was the only child I met who wasn’t accompanied by a guardian. She was alone in Virginia, staying with a Palestinian-American family who volunteered through Heal Palestine to host her. She’d made friends at school, and was learning English. When I asked about her favorite music she lit up. She loved Al Shami, a pop singer from Syria.</p><p>Baylasan’s mother survived that bombing, and after being evacuated for treatment in Turkey with Baylasan, had traveled to Belgium. Baylasan’s brother had been studying there when the assault on Gaza began. He had succeeded in obtaining a visa for their mother, who traveled there after Baylasan departed for the US. The family hopes to receive asylum in Belgium, a process that could take18 months.</p><p>When we met, Baylasan was completing intensive physical therapy at the Prosthetic Care Facility of Virginia. Her father remained in Gaza, where an amputation virtually guarantees a life of social isolation, no access to support services, and limited opportunity for emotional recovery.</p><p>When I asked Baylasan whether her father had the means to join the family in Belgium, she gave me an exasperated look; it was a stupid question.</p><p>“Raho al masary. Inharago.”</p><p>The money’s gone. It burned.</p><p>Gaza was a difficult place before October of 2023. My ownmemoriesof life there – I was born in Rafah – are imbued with a feeling of closeness, of being hemmed in. For many people, education was the only path to a better life, which perhaps helps explain why literacy rates in Gaza exceeded 97.8% for adults. The degree of educational attainment was also reflected in therelatively well-developedmedical infrastructure in the territory.</p><p>Doctors Without Bordersreports that before the Israeli assault, there were 36 hospitals serving 2.3 million residents in Gaza – one for every 60,500 people. People in the US havemore access– one hospital for every 23,500 people – but the development of the healthcare sector surpassed what could be reasonably expected in light of Israel’s longstanding siege on the impoverished territory.</p><p>Today, most of that infrastructure no longer exists. Gaza’sreconstructionwill require more than $50bn over 10 years, according to a UN, EU and World Bank assessment. That’s saying nothing about the lost human capital, the doctors and nurses and the people who educate and train them. The Guardianreportsthat more than 1,000 healthcare professionals were killed by the Israeli military. Of Gaza’s 36 hospitals, only 16 are partially functioning today, according to aUN report. If critically injured, disabled people in Gaza could lead dignified, productive lives before 2023, that no longer seems possible.</p><p>Organizations like Heal Palestine and thePalestine Children’s Relief Fundhave worked assiduously, against long odds in challenging conditions, to meet some of the need. Steve Sosebee, who leads Heal Palestine, described the organization’s work as comprehensive. Its staff operate a field hospital in Gaza. They also manage a mental health program and food kitchens there. The organization has also facilitated the evacuation of and care for 37 severely injured children. It continues to provide mental healthcare even after their physical wounds have healed.</p><p>“We get them the medical care that they need but otherwise don’t have access to,” Sosebee explained. “We’re also providing a holistic approach to their healing which is mental health therapy, education and community support.”</p><p>Many of those who escaped Gaza for medical treatment – including the 11 children I met with in the US and Egypt – did so before Israeli troops overran the Rafah border with Egypt in May of last year. Their petitions for medical evacuation involved a long chain of coordination through the health ministry in Gaza, the Egyptian government, the World Health Organization and the Israeli army. Typically they traveled to the Rafah border with Egypt and from there were loaded into ambulances which then undertook the six-hour drive from the border to Cairo.</p><p>I met Marah and her mother, Amal, in Long Island. They were staying at a Ronald McDonald House, a facility that houses families with children who require long-term care, near the hospital where Marah was being treated.</p><p>Marah, who is one of seven children, was 16 when an Israeli bomb struck her aunt’s house in Al-Shaboura, in Rafah, where she was sheltering. Both of her legs had been amputated above the knee, near her pelvis.</p><p>In New York, Marah had numerous surgeries to prepare her for prosthesis. When we met, she was learning to walk – a process which is markedly more difficult for those with amputations above the knee. Her days are filled with physical therapy and more physical therapy, as she put it to me.</p><p>The family’s nightmare began early, and like virtually everyone else I spoke with, continued until they left Gaza.</p><p>In October 2023, an Israeli airstrike destroyed the family home in Al Zeitoun in northern Gaza, sending them to seek shelter in Marah’s aunt’s home. Eight days later, another bomb killed her brother, her sister, her brother-in-law; and one of her sister’s young daughters.</p><p>Another niece, a 15-month-old child named Mona, survived the bombing with serious injuries. The family took Mona with them and fled south to the home of another one of Marah’s aunts in Rafah. At 3am, two months after arriving, the bombers struck again. A missile exploded in the room where Marah was sleeping with Mona.</p><p>The toddler was killed in that bombing, joining her mother, father and baby sister in death.</p><p>“I remember waking up briefly in the rubble and calling for my father. I thought he hadn’t heard me and I said theshehada[an Islamic prayer] three times and after that I don’t have any memory of the next two or three weeks,” Marah told me.</p><p>Marah’s legs were badly lacerated and mangled; she had multiple fractures and a head injury. She was taken to a hospital which, lacking resources, directed her rescuers to another hospital.</p><p>Overwhelmed staff at the second hospital believed she was dead and moved her to the morgue.</p><p>“My [surviving] brother – he’s three years older than I am. He came close to say goodbye to me and came close to my face and saw that I was breathing. He told the doctor: ‘She’s breathing.’”</p><p>Marah was in a coma for eight days, during which her doctors amputated her legs.</p><p>Marah’s mother, Amal, was also severely wounded in the strike that injured her daughter. She made a point of serving me coffee despite her difficulty walking.</p><p>“I had 22 operations,” Amal told me. “The fleshhad meltedoff my legs.”</p><p>Amal spent eight months at theEmiratihospital – a field hospital in Rafah, which was operating through the efforts of the UAE. She decided to leave, despite needing additional care, when she learned that Marah would be able to travel to New York for treatment through Heal Palestine. After extensive back and forth with Israeli and international officials, Marah succeeded in obtaining permission to leave. Heal Palestine coordinated her travel and care by enlisting the services of various hospitals and charities, and raising funds for travel. Marah’s father and brother remained in Gaza.</p><p>Marah and Amal will eventually have to travel to Egypt from New York, where they will await their return to Gaza.</p><p>I asked Amal about her hopes for her daughter’s future.</p><p>“There is no future in Gaza for someone like Marah,” she told me, gesturing to her daughter in her wheelchair. “I want her to complete her education.”</p><p>I traveled to Cairo to meet children who had been injured and were receiving care there. I wanted to see too, what life could be like for Marah, Elias, Khaled and Taline, all of whom are meant to go to Egypt after completing treatment in the US.</p><p>I met Malik, a little eight-year-old boy who had suffered a severe head injury when his home in Gaza was bombed, in a suburb of Cairo. He had been evacuated to the US where doctors had performed a cranioplasty – a titanium plate covered most of the back of his head. After three months of treatment in Florida, he and his mother returned to Egypt in August of last year. Malik slurred his speech but had learned to walk again by the time we met – he accompanied me to the store to buy chocolate for him and his sisters.</p><p>Ibtisam, Malik’s mother, described pulling him from the rubble from an airstrike on their home in Nuseirat on 8 January 2024.</p><p>“I called for my girls; they were screaming and crying. It was dark – you couldn’t see anything. I called for Malik but he didn’t respond,” she said.</p><p>“I started feeling around in the dark … I found a pile of hot rubble and glass. I started to uncover him there. I pulled him out and was cut by glass. I held him. He was awake but he wasn’t responding to me. I cradled his head with my hand and my hand went inside – into his head.”</p><p>Prospects for a life in Egypt are better for those with life-altering injuries than they are in Gaza, but public infrastructure there cannot truly support the needs of disabled people.</p><p>I spoke with a developmental neuroscientist who leads a lab at a large research university in Philadelphia. He requested anonymity because of his lab’sreliance on fundingprovided by the National Institutes of Health, which is at risk under the Trump administration.</p><p>“[Brain development] is a process of refining cellular connections postnatally,” he explained.</p><p>“Kids’ brains are remarkably resilient and can recover from things that adult brains never could … but there is a limit to the ability to repair and rewire around injuries.”</p><p>Brain-injured patients need years of support from “trained physical therapists and occupational therapists and physicians to really maximize the amount of recovery [they] can get”, he said. That’s in addition to the child psychologists who are tasked with addressing the post-traumatic stress disorders that attend trauma.</p><p>Dr Hazem Madi, a Palestinian doctor from Gaza who managed to escape to Cairo in February 2024, explained that while private hospitals in the Egyptian capital can meet a high standard of care, many public hospitals cannot. Access to occupational therapists and child psychologists is limited as well.</p><p>An Amnesty International reportelaborates: “Egypt’s public healthcare system has been struggling with a shortage of public hospital beds, offering only 1.4 beds per 1,000 people, which is significantly below the global average of 2.9 beds per 1,000 people.” In that regard, Malik is more fortunate than others. Heal Palestine has facilitated his ongoing mental and physical therapy in Cairo.</p><p>Beyond medical care, Egyptian authorities do not permit Palestinian refugees from Gaza –roughly 100,000people – to register their children in public school. Malik and his sisters were attending school remotely – teachers in Gaza had succeeded in organizing virtual learning, albeit haphazardly and unevenly.</p><p>Nor can the challenge of earning a living be overstated. Malik’s family rely on Heal Palestine for housing – the organization rents an apartment for them in 6 October City near Cairo. But the aid won’t last forever, and Palestinians in Egypt lack residency permits andcannot work. Their status is, like so much about their lives, precarious.</p><p>Amna, the young mother I met in Philadelphia, searched frantically for her husband and children after the strike at the nurse’s home.</p><p>“When I saw them I was shocked. Elias’s leg was gone. Taline looked … Her legs were mangled. Shredded. They were going to die. I collapsed. Khaled carried his brother out and he returned and carried his sister out. Can you imagine a nine-year-old in that situation?”</p><p>Her husband sustained a leg injury too. The family spent a night in the stairwell. The ambulance never came – no one would risk the drive to Jabalia. Tourniquets kept the children alive through the night.</p><p>“All night – I want you to imagine – all night. My kids are saying I need water. Please give me water. All night. The bombing was going all night. It wouldn’t stop.”</p><p>The area was bombed again in the morning. Someone suggested they try to evacuate to a nearby school.</p><p>“Everyone said we have to go. Everyone was fleeing from death. My husband couldn’t stand. How was I going to move my children? I said I’m not going anywhere. I can’t leave Elias and Taline.”</p><p>A stranger came along and offered to carry Elias and Taline. He helped make crutches from discarded wood for Amna’s husband and encouraged him to try to walk. The school was no more than 200 meters away.</p><p>Amna started to walk, which was difficult since she had given birth by C-section 10 days earlier.</p><p>“There were people in front of me,” she said. “They had their kids. They were shelled. Limbs. Things that I still can’t comprehend. Those people wanted to enter the school and they were killed … The soldiers shelled them.”</p><p>Amna fled into a nearby house and was separated from her husband, who was with Taline and Elias. She remained with Khaled and her infant, Faris. “I didn’t know if Elias and Taline were alive or dead. If my husband was dead.”</p><p>Elias and Taline found refuge with their father at al-Shifa hospital. They received basic care, keeping them alive.</p><p>Amna spent two days in hiding until the Israeli troops withdrew. Finally, she left with her baby and son Khaled, who carried a makeshift white flag. They emerged into a new landscape.</p><p>“We were barefoot. Everything was destroyed. No school. No hospital. The landmarks – it wasn’tJabaliaany more.”</p><p>Eventually, she made her way to al-Shifa, the last operating hospital in the area. There, she found her husband with Elias and Taline.</p><p>“They were on the ground. The crowd was unbelievable. People stepping on one another. My children were on the ground.</p><p>“I gave the doctor my infant. He said to me: ‘Your son needs oxygen’ – there was none. ‘Try to nurse him – hold him.’</p><p>“I understood. My son was going to die. Hours or a day or two – he was going to die. Six hours later he died. Faris died. He was 12 days old.”</p><p>Amna buried Faris in the Shifa cemetery, the one Khaled would walk through after it had been bulldozed by Israeli forces.</p><p>Soon after Faris died, an ambulance drove Amna, Taline and Elias south to another hospital in Rafah. Weeks later, she secured permission to leave Gaza with Elias. An Egyptian border guard was moved by Taline’s condition and said he would let her out too. Soon after that, Khaled was allowed to travel south in an ambulance with a cousin who had been injured. Eventually, he was permitted to join his mother in Cairo.</p><p>The children’s father stayed behind in Jabalia, which was bombed again this month.</p><p>I met Baylasan in December of 2024. In March, I learned that she had been reunited with her mother and brother in Belgium, where Heal Palestine is providing them with housing. For now, Baylasan is completing her physical therapy treatment virtually. When it’s time she will travel back to Virginia for a new prosthesis. Baylasan’s father remains in Gaza.</p><p>Marah and her mother were supposed to leave for Egypt in March, but the severity of Marah’s injuries led her doctors to conclude that she needed at least another nine months of therapy and treatment in the US. She’s now studying for a high school equivalency exam.</p><p>Elias, Taline and Khaled are enrolled in school in Philadelphia. Taline may have another surgery scheduled in the spring, an attempt to save her leg.</p><p>In November of 2024 – the same month I first visited Marah – hundreds of Israelis traveled to Amsterdam to watch a football match. They received a lot of attention when they attacked, and were attacked by, locals there. Yet in all the reporting, one provocation stood out to me: the Israeli visitorssang: “Why is school out in Gaza”?</p><p>And they answered: “There are no children left.”</p><p>Almost all of the small children I met in the course of writing this story carried haunted looks. I asked them things like “What are your hobbies?” and “What’s your favorite show on television?” and I was met, mostly, by blankness. Beyond their physical injuries, they have experienced unspeakable loss. Their schools, their neighborhoods are gone. Many of their loved ones, siblings and friends are now dead.</p><p>If childhood is a time of innocence, small hurts and joys, playground anxieties and high drama, then, the Israeli fans, for all their venom, were right. There is no childhood in Gaza.</p>

        <p>A heavy, cast-iron pot is a kitchen staple – but they’re not all made (or priced) equally. I put three to the test</p><p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

While other retailers including Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Argos and John Lewis also stock cheap cast-iron, Aldi’s, at £19.99, is by far the cheapest. It’s also only available “while stocks last”.</p><p>The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.</p><p>Any cookbook worth its salt will, at some point, tell you to simmer/boil/fry/saute something in a “heavy-bottomed” pot or saucepan. Contrary to lightweight postwar aluminium fare, a pot with a decent weight to it retains and distributes heat more evenly, ensuring food cooks better (and slower). The ultimate in all-round heavy pots – and kitchen status symbols –come from Le Creuset. Founded by two Belgians in the tiny northern French town of Fresnoy-le-Grand, this foundry produced its first bright orange (a colour known as Flame in Le Creuset parlance) cocottes in 1925. Such was the international engouement they provoked early on, that the company still makes exactly the same products, in the same way.</p><p>The coloured enamel exteriors have been central to their appeal from the outset: that original volcanic orange was inspired by the colour of molten metal. Marilyn Monroe had a whole collection in Elysee Yellow thatsold at a New York auction in 1999 for $25,300and cookbook authorElizabeth David, a lifelong fan, inspired a range in Gauloise blue. The latest iterations come in all sorts of colours with names like Berry and Bamboo. Each costs a small fortune.</p><p>The last time the French brand held a warehouse sale – in Andover, Hampshire, in November 2024 – the police were called because hard-nosed hopefulswere lining the London Road and the A3093 for miles. One couple, who queued for four hours,TikTokked a massive haul of about 50 itemson which, they said, they’d saved £1,614.50 (paying £1,127 instead of £2,741.50 at full price). This included a classic round casserole dish that would have cost them £369 full price, but for which they only paid £159.</p><p>It makes perfect sense, then, that supermarkets should be clambering to produce imitation Le Creusets, but finding one of theAldicast-iron casseroles is a tricky business. I trekked to the brand’s superstore in Leyton, east London, the day after they were released and unearthed the last two, hidden mid-aisle in the jumbled product bins. They come in one size only – 22cm in diameter, with a volume of four litres – and two colours: Pepto-Bismol pink or night-sky blue.</p><p>An Aldi shop assistant told me he’d bought a large blue frying pan in the same range, now completely sold out, a couple of weeks earlier. He was delighted with the purchase and, at that price (a cool £12.99), you would be too. The Le Creuset casserole closest in size (a 24cm / 4.2 litre model) to the Aldi one costs £305. For that amount, you could buy 14 Aldi pots (with change). Or one Aldi pot, and have enough money left over to buy yourself a cheap hob and oven. The question then is: are they any good?</p><p>I have a small Le Creuset cocotte which I use to make things likeMarcella Hazan’s slow-simmer tomato sauceor Japanese pork curry. I use it for cooking Japanese rice, too; and as a Dutch oven for baking. I try cooking all of these things in both a pink Aldi number, and a greyM&S medium casserole dish(21.2 cm / 2.8 litre, £35), as a comparison.</p><p>I find the Aldi lid doesn’t fit quite as snugly as the Le Creuset’s and the M&S’s – all the steam rushes out of the pot and my rice comes out harder than it should. Other than that, cooking with both pots is comparable to the Le Creuset.</p><p>I’ve always associated enamelled cast-iron with gas or fire cooking but these pots work just as well on any other hob, including induction. Leiths cookery school graduate and foodie content creator Tyler Butt has garnered millions of followerson TiktokandInstagramwith homely dishes like shepherd’s pie, made in exactly this kind of casserole dish on – and in – an Aga.</p><p>Honey and Co’s Sarit Packer, meanwhile, has a 20-year collection of cast-iron pots and pans at home that she uses on an electric hob. “We love the heat distribution and that they fit in the oven to cook through or just keep warm,” she says. Her absolute best use of the pans, she adds, is to braise a whole chicken with vegetables “and maybe a splash of wine and some spices, simply in a medium hot oven for two hours without paying any attention to it as it cooks. You get a great no-stress dinner for four.”</p><p>I don’t roast three whole chickens, but to test the pots in the oven, I do bake a batch of cinnamon rolls in each. Here too, the bakes come out great – no discernible differences.</p><p>The rules for using a cast-iron pot are simple: don’t heat it up too quickly (a danger particularly on induction hobs), or heat it up dry, without oil or liquid. Don’t use it over a too high heat. Don’t put a hot pan under cold water. Don’t use metal utensils or abrasive cleaners; don’t scrub with metal wool. I’ve definitely, foolishly, ruined a Le Creuset cast-iron milk pan before by not following this guidance. So, that’s precisely what I try to do now, with both the Aldi and the M&S.</p><p>I purposely burn the curry and the rice. I scald milk. I melt sugar until it’s black and smoking. I put hot pans under a cold tap, scrape them with knives and metal spoons, and scour them inside and out with metal wool.</p><p>The most damage I manage to inflict is a few grey lines on the otherwise beautifully smooth enamel: both still look new. Of course, I didn’t ruin my Le Creuset milk pan in one go, and my extant Le Creuset cocotte I’ve had for over a decade. All of which suggests that the real test will be how these cheapos fare in time.</p><p>Neil Currie, the co-founder ofShropshire’s Netherton Foundry, started designing cookware and appliances straight out of art school in 1981. He worked for both Lidl and Aldi and says they would remove all and any unnecessary components, stripping the product down to the bare minimum – which sometimes actually resulted in a better product.</p><p>When it comes to cast-iron cookware, however, there’s nothing extraneous to strip out. Production is as basic as it gets: molten metal is poured into a sand mould, cooled, cleaned and enamelled. To Currie’s mind, a £20 cast-iron pot sounds “too good to be true”.</p><p>He cautions that provenance and process are of key importance. French brands such as Le Creuset and Staub, he says, are so expensive because of labour costs. They still hand-produce their cast-iron pots on site, meaning the purity and relative food safety of the raw materials they use are guaranteed. A Le Creuset casserole is sand-cast with a mix of iron and recycled steel andinspected, by hand, by 40 people. It comes with a lifetime guarantee, covering “faulty workmanship and/or materials when the product is used in normal, domestic conditions and in accordance with the care and use instructions provided”.</p><p>Both M&S and Aldi, by contrast, simply specify that their cast-iron pots are “made in China” – which is a bit nebulous when you consider that some estimates put the number of Chinese sand-casting foundries across the country at over 20,000.</p><p>Similarly, just what the metal is coated with is important. “Iron is cheaper than aluminium, weight for weight,” Currie says, “but it always takes much, much more finishing. Putting that finish on the top is often as expensive as making the pan itself.” Cast-iron casseroles are typically coated in vitreous enamel: a layer of coloured glass powder fused to the metal by firing at temperatures upwards of 800C (1,472F). The colours (Le Creuset’s rainbow of shades, Aldi’s pink, that M&S grey) are achieved by adding in different metals, which, because it’s cookware, need to be food-grade. Currie says this is why not many people do enamel work in the UK these days: “You have to ensure you’ve got the right metals and they’re not leaching out. It is hard and very difficult to control.” Longstanding French foundries such as Le Creuset, meanwhile, have perfected their enamelling craft for over a hundred years, and they still do it all in-house.</p><p>If the enamel chips, the metal is exposed. Iron, of course, will rust. If it’s on the outside, you can oil it to prevent rusting, which the Le Creuset website says is safe. If the enamel is chipped on the inside of a pot, the company’s website says “we recommend submitting a warranty claim so the piece can be evaluated”. By contrast, the Aldi casserole dish simply specifies “3 layers of enamel coating” and a promise to replace or refund if the customer is not entirely satisfied with the product. The M&S version cautions users to handle with care to avoid chipping the enamel coating. In other words, these cheap pots come with much less information, and no guarantees.</p><p>On balance, then, as metallurgists and traditionalists will tell you, French does seem to be best in terms of artisanal heft and quality control. Clearly, no one really needs over a grand’s worth of Le Creuset wares, but if you can afford to invest in even just one, it makes sense to do so.</p><p>Second-hand is a great option. As bakerDavid Lebovitzhas put it: “I actually love seeing the well-used pieces at the flea markets in France, because many people have kept their Le Creuset pots and pans in their families, handing them down from generation to generation. Some I put back because they’re too far gone, others I haggle for – or just pay up because it’s too good to leave behind – and a few I regret not acting faster on, seeing them snapped up by others.”</p><p>At the same time, though, these cheaper versions are certainly much sturdier, and therefore less wasteful, than cheap nonstick pans, which cookware experts will tell you typically last only between one and five years. So, as long as, over time, you do not treat them as I did, the cast-iron equivalents have the potential to last a lot longer. That has to count for something.</p>

        <p>The leaking of top-level military secrets was bad enough, but I’m obsessed with Maga’s fratboy lexicon</p><p>The Maga-fication of American political discourse, whichstarted, arguably, with Donald Trumpmocking a disabled reporterin 2015, peaked this week with news of Pete Hegseth referring to European countries in the leaked Signal chat as “PATHETIC”, and enjoyed a detour last Tuesday when Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and former running mate of Kamala Harris, appeared at a town hall in Wisconsin and called Elon Musk “a dipshit”. (This is not the first time he has referred to Musk this way. Right before the election last year,Walz told a crowd: “Look, Elon’s on that stage, jumping around, skipping like a dipshit.”)</p><p>Parking for a moment the perfection of the phrase “skipping like a dipshit” to capture Musk’s very particular style of movement and speech, the range of what can and can’t be said in politics has clearly, radically changed. When you look back on the phrase that caused Hillary Clinton so much trouble in 2016 – “basket of deplorables” – it sounds like a quote from an 18th-century novel. “Take that, sir! You and your basket of deplorables!” Now we have Trump referring to Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic editor mistakenly added to the Signal chat, as a “sleazebag”, and Hegseth, the US defense secretary, telling JD Vance that he fully shares the vice-president’s “loathing of European free-loading”. We are millimetres away from someone shouting “asshole” across the floor of the Senate.</p><p>The Signal chat, obviously, wasn’t supposed to be public, and responding to the leak this week has put the White House in a delicious bind – or rather, a bind that we might have enjoyed as delicious had it not underscored just how petrifyingly stupid Trump’s team really is. On Wednesday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, had simultaneously to dismiss further revelations from the Atlantic designed to expose the White House lie that none of the information discussed was classified, whileslamming the magazinefor leaking “sensitive information”. Well, Karoline, which is it?</p><p>The new information shared by the Atlantic on Wednesday was, to use government-approved language, freaking MIND-BLOWING. Two hours before the Yemeni bombing raid, Hegseth, Vance and national security adviser Mike Waltz went intoextraordinary detailas to the exact timing, nature and target of the bombings. “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s),” wrote Hegseth, followed by a stream of similar details. After the release of the information on Wednesday, retired military brass lined up in the US to tell cable news channels: “There is no question this is classified.”</p><p>And while it remained deeply unfortunate for theTrump administrationthat, of all the people they might have mistakenly cc-ed into the group, it happened to be a serious journalist like Jeffrey Goldberg, given the frat boy tenor of the exchange, it could also have been a lot worse. We should, surely, be grateful that Mike Waltz, the national security adviser who organised the group on Signal, didn’t do that thing – look, we’ve all done it – where you inadvertently send a bitchy message about someone to the person in question, or in this case a message outlining a plan to drop a bomb on their head to the Houthi rebel commander target. Or as Waltz described him, in the style of a man shooting the breeze at the water cooler, “their top missile guy”. One assumes the only reason that guy wasn’t in the chat, too, is that he hadn’t gotten around to signing up for Signal.</p><p>It’s not the rudeness, of course, it’s the flippancy that terrifies. The tone of the messages flying between the most powerful people in the world via an unsecure messaging app and on subjects of vital national security was that of someone idly texting with one hand while throwing and catching a hacky sack in the other. At one point, per Wednesday’s new trove, Mike Waltz wrote “typing too fast” and it must have taken every shred of collective will power in the group for no one to reply, “Sausage fingers!”</p><p>Waltz, by the way, is the figure who has come closest to saying sorry for the mess, remarking on Fox News on Tuesday that he took “full responsibility” for the error. But then he ruined the vanishingly rare moment of appearing to be the only adult in the room by referring to Goldberg – a hero without whom none of us would know any of this had happened – as “scum”. And, sadly, back we went to square one.</p><p>Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist</p>

        <p>Luke Littler earnedback-to-back Premier League victorieswith a 6-1 win over Luke Humphries in the final at Newcastle. Littler also beat Stephen Bunting and Rob Cross on his way to a fourth win of the competition.</p><p>Both Littler and Humphries had previously met in two finals during this season’s Premier League, with one win each. Humphries cut a frustrated figure as “the Nuke” stormed into a 4-0 lead with three successive double 20 checkouts.</p><p>Missed doubles proved costly for the world No 1 throughout the contest as Littler eased to victory and admitted afterwards he overcame some tiredness during Thursday’s showpiece. He said: “I’m very happy with my performances tonight, obviously it drifted off a bit towards the end, feeling a bit tired. I’m just good to get over that winning line in the final.</p><p>“My normal throw, or what I was throwing with tonight, I just felt tired so changed it up a bit. After the match Luke said he was tired, but I just had to stick in there. I’m feeling well. Tonight I was feeling tired when I would’ve been last week in the final. It’s all about making sure in yourself you’re right and [can] get up on stage to play these games.”</p><p>An impressive evening for Littler started with a dominant quarter-final victory over Bunting, where in 10 minutes he earned a 6-0 win, averaging just under 110. Bunting remains bottom of the standings without a win so far, but Littler hopes he can get that much-needed victory under his belt.</p><p>“I think last week he said he’s putting too much pressure on himself, without a win in eight weeks,” Littler said. “If I were Stephen you’ve just got to relax, saying come on win that first game. I’m sure once he gets that first win and gets that winning feeling he’ll go on, I think he could win a night.”</p><p>Another dominant display leaves Littler eight points clear at the top of the table, having won 16 matches in total. He added: “I think that does go to show how everyone says I am the best in the world at the minute. But you know me, I’ll never really say I am the best in the world, but I’m performing better than these guys, so maybe I should be saying I’m the best in the world, but we’ll just see how it goes.”</p><p>Sign up toThe Recap</p><p>The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>On his way to the final, Humphries went the full distance with Nathan Aspinall in their thrilling semi-final clash, edging a 6-5 win with an average of just under 107. In the quarter-finals, he met Chris Dobey, who was competing in front of his hometown crowd, which included some ofNewcastle’s Carabao Cup-winning team. Dobey’s homecoming was dampened by Humphries, who wrapped up a 6-3 win with double 16.</p>

        <p>Figures reveal 29% fall in operations in England to remove foreign bodies from children’s airways, noses and throats</p><p>Cashless societies may be a sad fact of modern life for those with a nostalgic attachment to the pound in their pocket, but doctors have discovered one unexpected benefit of the decline of coins.</p><p>Far fewer children are having surgery after swallowing small items that could choke or kill them, and the scarcity of loose change is likely to be the reason.</p><p>The number of children inEnglandneeding an operation to remove a foreign body from their nose, throat or airway fell significantly between 2012 and 2022, NHS figures show.</p><p>The fall has been greeted with relief by doctors and surgeons, who for years have been warning of the dangers posed by young children ingesting magnets, tiny batteries and other risky objects.</p><p>The number of under-18s undergoing surgery on their nose, airway or throat for that reason has declined from 2,405 in 2012 to 1,716 in 2022 – a fall of 29% or 689 cases in the year.</p><p>The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCSE), which obtained the figures, collated from hospital admission data, identified the rise of the cashless society as the main reason.</p><p>“Historically, coins accounted for over 75% of objects swallowed by children under six years old, and fewer coins in homes due to contactless payments have likely helped reduce the number of these procedures,” it said.</p><p>For example, surgeons performed 484 (31%) fewer procedures to remove something from a child’s nose in 2022 compared with 2012. There were 28% fewer on the digestive tract in the same age group and 8% fewer involving their airways.</p><p>However, the RCSE said that, despite the drop, parents should still be alert to the risk of their child swallowing shiny objects that looked like coins, such as button batteries and magnets.</p><p>“These can cause deadly internal complications within hours of ingestion, leading to tragic consequences,” it added.</p><p>This week,reportstold how one-year-old Araya Whateley had to have her bowel removed after ingesting six metal balls from a toy belonging to her nine-year-old sister.</p><p>Sign up toFirst Edition</p><p>Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>Parents who suspect their child may have ingested something dangerous should take them straight to hospital to get checked out, according to the body that represents Britain’s A&E doctors.</p><p>“If any carer thinks a child has swallowed an item they shouldn’t have, take them to A&E – even if they have no symptoms. In cases like this, it really is better to be safe than sorry,” said Dr Adrian Boyle, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine.</p><p>“As a parent, I know we all do our best to be vigilant as to what our children are putting in their mouths. But it is impossible to monitor them all the time.”</p><p>Prof Stephen Powis,NHSEngland’s national medical director, said: “At a time when demand on NHS services is so high, trends like this one which reduces hospital attendances is not only good for children, but also for our under-pressure staff.”</p>

    <h1>FA Cup quarter-finals: what to look out for this weekend</h1>

        <p>Talismanic strikers hold the key as teams seek a place at Wembley in the most open FA Cup race for years</p><p>For seven of the eight clubs left in the competition, this year’s FA Cup represents a historic opportunity. Four of the quarter-finalists – Fulham, Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Brighton – have never won the Cup, while Nottingham Forest (1959), Aston Villa (1957) and Preston (1938) last lifted the trophy before the advent of colour television. With the international break ending and midweek league fixtures coming for every team, there will be a temptation to rotate starters and rest tired legs. Still, the delirious scenes at Wembley as Newcastleended their trophy droughtinthe Carabao Cup finalshould be on every manager’s mind. With Manchester City, the tentative favourites, in an usually vulnerable state, this is the most open race the FA Cup has delivered in years, with a prize not to be taken for granted.NMc</p><p>It has been almost a month since Liam Roberts’shorrific head-high tackleon Jean-Philippe Mateta left the Crystal Palace striker requiring 25 stitches to an injury to his left ear. The France international will wear a protective mask while the healing process continues, but he is ready to play after a return to training. Many will have feared the worst when he lay on the Selhurst Park pitch amid lengthy treatment, but he has made a swift recovery. Palace supporters will be desperate to see him back for a chance at what would be a fifth FA Cup semi-final since 1990. It will be a huge boost for teammates and fans alike to see the talismanic Mateta return, and it might just give Oliver Glasner’s side – whowon at Craven Cottagein the league last month – the edge.WU</p><p>Fulham vCrystal Palace, Saturday12.15pmGMT</p><p>There is nothing like a 48-hour round trip to prepare a player for one of the biggest games of his career. Chris Wood wandered off to Wellington to plunder a hat-trick for New Zealand against the 148th best team in the world, Fiji, before netting another in a 3-0 win over New Caledonia, but was later substituted owing to injury as the All Whites secured World Cup qualification. Wood, who covers more than 100,000 miles a year to keep up with his international commitments, is now unavailable for Nottingham Forest’s quarter-final trip to Brighton. His absence will give Taiwo Awoniyi an opportunity from the start. Before Wood’s resurgence, the Nigerian was an imperative part of Forest’s success but injury and lack of minutes have stifled his development. He still has the ability to terrorise defences and could be the man to make the difference and take his side to Wembley.WU</p><p>Brighton v Nottingham Forest, Saturday5.15pmGMT</p><p>Aston Villa very considerately sent Kaine Kesler-Hayden to Preston last summer for the fifth loan spell of his career. The 22-year-old has made only five senior appearances for his parent club, hence the requirement for him to gain experience in the Championship. It seems extremely unfair that he is not eligible to play against Villa on Sunday, leaving Preston short of a player and Kesler-Hayden to miss out on an incredible opportunity. Surely Unai Emery is not afraid that his third-choice right-back is better than what he currently has in his squad, and would like to see what he can do to prove he has a long-term future at Villa Park. Admittedly, it would put Kesler-Hayden in an awkward position but he would no doubt prefer a chance to reach the top of the game. An FA Cup quarter-final is not a regular or guaranteed occurrence in anyone’s playing career.WU</p><p>Preston v Aston Villa, Sunday1.30pmBST</p><p>Ederson missed Manchester City’s final game before the international break,against Brighton, with an abdominal injury, forcing him to withdraw from the Brazil squad. In what is likely to be a summer of change at Manchester City, the goalkeeper’s future looks uncertain and he could be sold to make way for a new acquisition. Having won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League with City, he has nothing to prove but after a subpar season the run-in could be crucial for his legacy. The FA Cup is the only piece of silverware left on the table for City before they head to the Club World Cup. If fit Ederson will almost certainly replace Stefan Ortega at the Vitality Stadium, wherecracks in City’s title defencefirst began to show in November. Pep Guardiola will want his goalkeeper to set the tone for the rest of the team, who must overcome Bournemouth and get to Wembley to salvage something from a disappointing season.WU</p><p>Bournemouth vManchester City,4.30pmBST</p><p>Whatever the outcome of the weekend’s four ties, we can all hope that video technology is not among the main talking points come Monday morning. The frantic fifth-round drama was punctuatedby a record-breaking VAR delay of eight minutesduring Bournemouth’s tie against Wolves, which was partly down to the failure of semi-automated offside technology (SAOT). Despite working with barely a hitch in the Champions League and major international tournaments, SAOT appears to have been sucked into the twilight zone of Stockley Park during its trial phase on English soil. Having already been held back by the Premier League, plans to introduce SOAT in the next round of top-flight games have been postponed, but the experiment continues in three of the four Cup quarter-finals. Second-tier Preston’s Deepdale home is not equipped for the technology, adding an unwelcome layer of inequality – but at least shortening the odds of that particular game finishing on time.NMc</p>

    <h1>Stonewall will fight to ban all LGBT conversion practices, says new chief</h1>

        <p>Exclusive: Simon Blake says progress of government’s bill could be exploited by those attacking rights globally</p><p>The new head of Stonewall has pledged to fight for a ban on conversion practices that includes “every member of the lesbian, gay, bi and trans community”, as he said that the progress of Labour’s bill may be exploited by those pursuing global attacks on LGBTQ+ rights.</p><p>With the UK government expected to publish draft legislation this spring, Simon Blake said: “It’s really important that a conversion practices bill covers all practices designed to try to change or correct somebody’s sexual or gender identity.”</p><p>Interviewed at length for the first time since he took the post, Blake said the bill represented a reset between government, Stonewall and the wider LGBTQ+ sector, after Labour committed in its manifesto to a “full trans-inclusive ban” on conversion practices. This follows an increasingly toxic engagement with the previous Tory administration, in which Liz Truss, while equalities minister, urged all government departments to quit the charity’s workplace inclusion programme and plans for a similar banfell apart amid moves to exclude trans peopleand concerns about the introduction ofa loophole of “informed consent”.</p><p>Stonewall would have to “really work” around the parliamentary process to ensure initial commitments were not lost, said Blake, who expects opponents will play down the prevalence of conversion practices.</p><p>The charity is releasing new research on Friday that finds that 17% of LGBTQ+ Britons have experienced physical assault, 10% have experienced “exorcism” practices and 12% experienced “corrective rape” or sexual assault, all in an attempt to change their sexuality or gender identity.</p><p>While some of these are already illegal, campaigners hope that drawing them together under a blanket ban on conversion practices would strengthen recourse for victims as well as acting as a deterrent.</p><p>Critics of an inclusive ban suggest it could prevent parents having exploratory conversations with their gender-questioning children, while others –including Hilary Cass, the doctor who reviewed gender identity services for under-18s – have said it may impact on medical professionals’ capacity to advocate for a more cautious approach to transition.</p><p>But Blake said evidence from other countries that had already legislated for a ban did not support these anxieties.</p><p>“Of course parents will ask their children exploratory questions. What we are talking about here is conversion practices, which are saying ‘you are bad, you are wrong, you need to change’.</p><p>“I think we have to be really, really clear about the distinction between healthcare for young people – or anyone – and conversion practices and not conflate those issues.”</p><p>Blake suggested the bill might become a focus for opponents of progressive reform more widely. “This is a flagship policy at a time when we know that LGBT rights are being attacked on a global basis, with Trump, withpropaganda legislation[in Europe], and those who oppose LGBT rights will use the opportunity to spread misinformation and perpetuate divisive arguments.”</p><p>Regardless of pushback, Blake insisted the ban was “only one piece of the puzzle”.</p><p>“We need to see the UK take its place back at the top of the global leaderboard for LGBTQ+ rights and a government committed to this.”</p><p>Echoing thecomments of the screenwriter Russell T Davies, who said recently it felt more dangerous to be a gay man in the UK since Trump’s election, Blake agreed: “People are scared. It’s easy to think it’s happening in the US, in Italy, Spain, Georgia but we’re also hearing organisations and people in the UK who are saying it feels different, it feels less welcoming.”</p><p>Blake takes over as CEO after a turbulent period in Stonewall’s history, during which it attracted heavy censure for its stance on trans rights which critics both inside and outside the LGBT community believed was trying to shut down debate. One of its 14 co-founders, Matthew Parris, accused it of being“cornered into an extremist stance”.</p><p>Sign up toFirst Edition</p><p>Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters</p><p>after newsletter promotion</p><p>“It’s absolutely right that Stonewall became trans inclusive in 2015,” said Blake, drawing a distinction between the “public narrative” and “practical reality” that followed.</p><p>“Whilst the world has become more polarised and divisive and there was a lot of talking about Stonewall and trans issues, we were carrying on doing work for all members of the LGBT community.”</p><p>He added that there was merit in Stonewall amplifying trans-led organisations and working in partnership rather than “doing everything”.</p><p>Blake, who acknowledged there has been “huge division” over the issue, said that Stonewall had always navigated “incredibly well” through different views, with equal marriage as a recent example.</p><p>But some critics of Stonewall have pinpointed what they felt was the organisation’s own unwillingness to engage in respectful exchanges, be that with its earlier “no debate” policy on trans rights or previous boss Nancy Kelleycomparing gender critical beliefs to antisemitism.</p><p>Blake said: “I have heard that view, but looking ahead I’m clear we have only made progress and will only make progress through endless conversations with people who may share none or some of the same views.</p><p>“The problem with the current conversation about some elements of the LGBTQ+ rights agenda is it is about winning or losing, and that isn’t helpful,” he said.</p><p>“I want conversations where we are willing to listen to each other, seek to understand each other’s views and find ways for everyone to live side by side with dignity and respect.”</p>

        <p>The NAO has suggested that more popular vocational qualifications should be retained until T-levels can be fully evaluated</p><p>Popular sixth-form vocational qualifications such as BTecs should be retained until the success of T-level qualifications can be fully evaluated, the National Audit Office (NAO) has suggested.</p><p>In its investigation into the introduction of the new qualification launched in 2020, the NAO noted that T-levels had been less popular and more expensive than alternatives, with only 25,000 students enrolled this year, hampered by “uncertain” economic benefits.</p><p>The NAO recommended that theDepartment for Education(DfE) monitor “the potential impact on T-level demand, benefits, costs and approach before making wider strategic changes and decisions around the development of the technical qualifications landscape”.</p><p>The DfE had initially forecast that 100,000 students would be enrolled in the two-year qualification by 2027, when it planned to stopped funding “applied general qualifications” (AGQs) including many BTecs. But that forecast has since been revised down as fewer than expected students have enrolled, to a central estimate of fewer than 50,000 by 2027.</p><p>In contrast, more than 270,000 students are enrolled in at least one AGQ inEngland.</p><p>Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of parliament’s public accounts committee, said the NAO report “shows that a lack of widespread awareness, declining pass rates and challenges securing industry placements risk the DfE’s ability to scale up T-levels”.</p><p>Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth FormCollegesAssociation, said: “The report from the NAO reinforces the need to retain a middle pathway of applied general qualifications for students for whom neither A-levels nor T-levels present the best way forward.</p><p>“T-levels represent a vital opportunity to acquire the skills and experience that are essential for the workplace but they are not right for everyone, and we need to be confident that every young person can access a valuable and valued suite of qualifications in the future.”</p><p>Each T-level, in subjects such as marketing, accounting or health, is equivalent to three A-levels and as academically challenging, which critics say accounts for the lack of enthusiasm among potential students looking for vocational qualifications.</p><p>The courses also requires colleges to secure lengthy industry placements for students, which the NAO identified as likely to hamper expansion.</p><p>A DfE spokesperson said: “The £28m investment recently announced by the prime minister shows the government’s clear commitment to T-levels as a high-quality technical qualification which offers young people a great route into further study and a rewarding career.</p><p>“T-levels continue to grow, with nearly 60% more young people taking them last year than in the previous year.”</p>

Train companies, eager to capitalize on this newfound enthusiasm, have been racing to add new destinations, revive old ones or simply provide more seats on popular routes. Others have gone for luxury charters aimed at recreating the opulence of train travel in the past.</p><p>Withtravelers now spoiled, the selection below focuses on some constants: tried and tested routes that are easily accessible and offer the kind of beautiful scenery that has been a source of delight to travelers for decades, or even a century. Most of them run daily and come at no extravagant cost, yet still have special details that will make your journey comfortable, scenic and memorable.</p><p>Austria</p><p>The Transalpin from Zurich to Graz, Austria, is one of only a handful of trains with the Swiss Federal Railways’ first-class panorama car.

To make the most of the scenery, board the Treno Gottardo, a direct service from Basel or Zurich to Locarno. The train travels through the originalGotthard Tunnelfrom 1882 at above 3,000 feet. It spends about 10 minutes in the tunnel, allowing travelers plenty of time to take in the views on either side. You may be tempted to stop and explore the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, at the southern end of the route, before heading on to Milan or Venice on direct trains.</p><p>South of Lake Lucerne, the train climbs a series of bridges and spiral tunnels to reach snowy peaks before descending to Locarno on the palm-tree-lined shores of Lake Maggiore. The lake, with blue waters bordered by steep slopes, straddles Switzerland and Italy, and its tiny islands are home to elegant palazzos and lush gardens.</p><p>Times travel coverage.When our writers review a destination, they do not accept free or discounted services or, in most cases, reveal that they work for The Times.

    <h1>Justice Dept. Will Investigate California Universities Over Race in Admissions</h1>

        <p>Education</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>California banned affirmative action decades ago. The Trump administration says it plans to investigate whether schools there are still considering race.</p><p>ByStephanie Saul</p><p>The Department of Justice said on Thursday that it would investigate whether several California universities were complying with the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision banning the consideration of race in admissions.</p><p>The checks, which the Justice Department described as “compliance review investigations,” would target Stanford University and three schools in the University of California system — Berkeley, Los Angeles, and Irvine — according to an announcement released by Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p><p>“President Trump and I are dedicated to ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity across the country,” Ms. Bondi said in a statement.</p><p>It was not clear whether similar compliance reviews would be conducted at other colleges or universities across the nation.</p><p>The lawsuits that were the basis for the Supreme Court decision, in the case known as Students for Fair Admissions, were filed against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p><p>Plaintiffs in that case used statistical evidence, including standardized test scores, to support the contention that some racial groups, including Black and Hispanic students, had been given preferences in admissions. The plaintiffs argued the practice violated the 14th Amendment.</p><p>Unlike schools in most states, however, California public colleges and universities have been prohibited from using affirmative action in college admissions since Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996.</p><p>Enrollment of Black and Hispanic students and other minority groups dropped precipitously in the more selective public schools in California after the proposition was enacted. Since then it has rebounded at least somewhat. For example, Black enrollment at U.C.L.A. fell to 3.43 percent in 1998 from 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. (California’s population is 6.5 percent Black.)</p><p>As a private school, Stanford did not fall under the Proposition 209 requirements.</p><p>Stanford said in a statement that it had taken steps to comply with the Supreme Court decision and that it was “committed to fulfilling our obligations under the law.” The statement added that the school had not received any details about the investigation from the Justice Department.</p><p>The University of California system was not immediately available to comment on the Justice Department announcement.</p><p>The review follows a lawsuit filed in February accusing the University of California system of violating protections against racial discrimination in admissions. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Students Against Racial Discrimination, which was organized by a persistent critic of affirmative action, asked for a court order requiring that the system select students “in a colorblind manner,” to “eliminate the corrupt and unlawful race and sex preferences that subordinate academic merit to so-called diversity considerations.”</p><p>Separately on Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services said it was launching an investigation into accusations that a “major medical school” in California had used discriminatory admissions practices. It did not specify which school.</p><p>Stephanie Saulreports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.More about Stephanie Saul</p><p>Advertisement</p>

    <h1>The Substance of the Group Chat Was Unserious, Too</h1>

        <p>Advertisement</p><p>ByFarah Stockman</p><p>Editorial Board member</p><p>The most terrifying thing about the now-infamous Signal group chat isn’t the casual contempt for European allies that it reveals — that, sadly, is not new — but the picture it paints of unserious people at the helm of the U.S. national security apparatus. For weeks now, U.S. allies have wondered whether Americans would defend them in a war. Now many are wondering whether this made-for-Fox-News national security team is even capable of doing so without exposing military plans to the enemy.</p><p>“JD Vance and his mates clearly aren’t fit to run a group chat, let alone the world’s strongest military force,” Sir Ed Davey, a member of the British Parliament and the leader of the Liberal Democrats,saidon X. “It has to make our security services nervous about the intelligence we’re sharing with them.”</p><p>Although many foreign leaders kept mum about the scandal — why attract President Trump’s wrath? — signs of deep anxiety weren’t hard to find. Peter Boehm, a member of the Senate in Canada — a country that is reeling from Trump’s tariffs and his threats to make it the 51st state — told me that countries might begin to quietly limit the intelligence that they share with the United States, depending on the subject matter. And Richard Fadden, Canada’s former spy chief, told The Guardianthat“Canada needs to think about what this means in practical terms: Is the United States prepared to protect our secrets, as we are bound to protect theirs?”</p><p>Even in Israel, a close ally, a former senior official with the Mossad, the country’s spy agency, said the Signal episode “should serve as a major warning sign about how much we can trust U.S. intelligence during President Donald Trump’s second term,” according toan essay in the publication Haaretz.Still, he said, “our dependence on them is absolute,” so Israelis have little choice but to continue sharing intelligence. “The whole situation is insane,” he said.</p><p>What feels revelatory about the Signal chat is just how unserious this national security team is. It’s not just the emojis or the accidental inclusion of a journalist or the decision to communicate on that app. It’s how focused members of the chat group were on how the attack would be perceived by Trump’s base, rather than on the potential geopolitical repercussions of their actions. Although this text thread was surely just a snippet of an ongoing conversation, it was disturbing that they spent more time discussing “messaging” than say, protecting an ally like Saudi Arabia from retaliation.</p><p>“There’s a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary,” the vice president wrote. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth replied, “I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what,” adding that “nobody knows who the Houthis are — which is why we need to stay focused on 1.) Biden failed & 2.) Iran funded.”</p><p>Hilariously, Hegseth goes on to say that delaying the operation risks that “this leaks, and we look indecisive” — unaware that the entire world would soon read about it.</p><p>Hegseth is a former Fox News host, chosen for loyalty and good looksrather than experience. His comments in the chat showcased not only the arrogance and disdain, but the carelessness and cluelessness, of the people in charge of what is supposed to be the world’s most powerful military. These people seem to care more about how things look than how they actually are. That, more than anything, should terrify America’s allies, and Americans themselves.</p><p>Farah Stockman joinedthe Times editorial boardin 2020.

        <p>TrumpAdministration</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, joined top Democrats in insisting that the president does not have the power to “pick and choose” what to fund.</p><p>ByCarl Hulse</p><p>Reporting from the Capitol</p><p>A top Senate Republican on Thursday accused President Trump of illegally refusing to spend $2.9 billion approved by Congress, teaming with Democrats in an early salvo in the simmering struggle between Congress and the White House over which has the ultimate power over federal spending.</p><p>Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, initiated a letter to the White House that was signed by Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the panel’s senior Democrat. The letter asserted that the administration had violated the six-month spending law approved by Congress earlier this month.</p><p>They pointed to a memo Mr. Trump had sent to Congress on Monday that declared that only a portion of the $12.4 billion designated as emergency funding in the legislation would actually be spent, “because I do not concur that the added spending is truly for emergency needs.”</p><p>The appropriators vigorously contested that assertion, arguing that the law requires the administration to spend all emergency money or none of it, and does not allow the president to decide for himself what money to spend and what not to.</p><p>“Just as the president does not have a line-item veto, he does not have the ability to pick and choose which emergency spending to designate,” the letter said.</p><p>They noted that the Trump administration’s interpretation of federal budget law was at odds with how presidents of both parties had viewed it for two decades.</p><p>“It is incumbent on all of us to follow the law as written — not as we would like it to be,” Ms. Collins and Ms. Murray wrote.</p><p>Documents compiled by the appropriations panel showed that the White House action would deny funding in 11 areas that it has already targeted for elimination or steep reductions, including $750 million in international disaster assistance, $750 million in migration and refugee assistance, $234 million for the National Science Foundation and $100 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among others.</p><p>It also withheld $115 million for international narcotics control and enforcement, a decision singled out by Ms. Collins as particularly confounding.</p><p>“Why would you want to do that, given the huge drug problem that we have had?” she said in an interview. “We need the help of other nations to stop that.”</p><p>In notifying Congress of his decision on Monday, Mr. Trump questioned the necessity of some of the funding and asserted the authority to allow some money to be distributed while blocking the rest.</p><p>He said the spending had been “improperly designated by Congress as emergency,” noting that it had been included as a “side deal” negotiated between Republicans and Democrats in 2023 to allow funding in excess of spending caps.</p><p>His decision was accompanied by a memorandum from Russell T. Vought, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, who asserted that the president’s action was justified.</p><p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Vought, who also headed the Office of Management and Budget in Mr. Trump’s first administration, argue that the budget law that gives Congress the power to set spending to be executed by the executive branch is unconstitutional. They contend that the president has the power to withhold money even if it was approved by Congress, a proposition likely to be ultimately tested in the courts.</p><p>Ms. Murray, in a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday, said the White House and its allies were ignoring a clear constitutional provision that gives Congress the power to set spending.</p><p>“Right now we have a couple of billionaires running our country straight into the ground who seem to have skipped American history because President Trump and Elon Musk don’t seem to care much about our Constitution,” she said. She pointed to the provision that “no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.”</p><p>“Their lack of interest in that section of the Constitution doesn’t make it any less real at all,” she said.</p><p>The decision by Ms. Collins to challenge the administration was notable since many Republicans on Capitol Hill have been silent on the administration’s attempts to assert extraordinary power over federal spending.</p><p>The fight over who has final authority over funding will hang over the coming debate for 2026 spending as the House and Senate assemble allocations for federal agencies.</p><p>In the House, Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, also lashed out at the spending edict. But her letter to Mr. Vought was not signed by Representative Tom Cole, the Oklahoma Republican who chairs the panel.</p><p>Ms. DeLauro accused Mr. Vought of providing “ineffective and misleading” advice to the president and putting the entire $12.4 billion — including $8 billion for rental assistance backed by both parties and $900 million for NASA — at risk since the law specifically said it was all or nothing.</p><p>“If you direct agencies to spend this money you would be requiring them to draw money from the Treasury, absent an appropriation made by law,” she wrote, saying that violation of the budget law carried the risk of fines and other punishment.</p><p>Ms. Collins said she and Ms. Murray were relying on legal opinions and findings by the Congressional Research Service that they were in the right and said they hoped to persuade Mr. Vought to reconsider his view.</p><p>“The best outcome would be if O.M.B. took a second look at this,” she said.</p><p>Carl Hulseis the chief Washington correspondent, primarily writing about Congress and national political races and issues.

        <p>Advertisement</p><p>Supported by</p><p>The data comes after researchers reported that the past 10 years have been the 10 hottest on record.</p><p>ByAustyn Gaffney</p><p>Earth is missing a lot of sea ice this year. Enough to cover the entire United States east of the Mississippi.</p><p>That was announced by researchers at NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center on Thursday, who said the amount of sea ice on the planet had reached thelowest level ever recorded in March.</p><p>The record comes days after the World Meteorological Organization reported thatthe past 10 years have been the 10 hottest on record, with 2024 the hottest year. The global rise in temperatures is tied to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels.</p><p>“Warming temperatures drive melting ice across the globe, and because we’re seeing such high temperatures, it’s not surprising that this year we’re seeing the least amount of ice coverage,” said Linette Boisvert, an ice scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.</p><p>The center has been compiling data for almost 50 years, primarily through a Department of Defense satellite program. The global sea ice extent includes measurements taken in both the Southern Hemisphere and the Northern Hemisphere, which experience opposite seasons.</p><p>Dr. Boisvert compared the freezing and melting of sea ice between winter and summer to the heartbeat of the planet. The pulses between the winter maximum and summer minimum used to be shorter. But with more sea ice melting away, the distance between pulses has grown larger.</p><p>“It’s like the heartbeat of the planet is slowing down,” Dr. Boisvert said. “It’s not good.”</p><p></p><p></p><p>Sea ice plays many important roles for the global climate: Its white surface can reflect energy back into space, helping the planet cool. It also acts like a blanket for the ocean, insulating it and preventing ocean heat from reaching the atmosphere. Less sea ice means more heat goes in Earth’s systems, warming the atmosphere and the oceans.</p><p>The extent of sea ice isn’t the only measurement scientists are tracking. The thickness of the ice also matters and, since the 1980s, Arctic sea ice has become thinner.</p><p>While thicker sea ice tends to survive the summer melt, nowadays most of the sea ice completely melts during the summer, preventing it from thickening year after year. More open ocean means more dark surfaces to absorb more heat from the sun, which in turn melts more ice. The melting becomes its own positive feedback loop.</p><p>Changes in remote polar regions affect the rest of the globe, including changes to ocean currents and weather patterns.</p><p>“It’s really important to have scientists’ eyes on the data,” Dr. Boisvert said. “It would be really detrimental not to have funding for this type of work.”</p><p>Melting sea ice also has negative implications for marine life, tourism in polar regions and global shipping. It’s important for military activities, Indigenous communities in Alaska and the fishing industry, according to Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, a research organization at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The trend of decreasing sea ice in the Arctic is an increasingly clear indicator of global warming, he said.</p><p>“We’re seeing something that’s pretty unprecedented, at least on scales of human society for thousands of years,” Dr. Meier said.</p><p>Under the Trump administration, scientific agencies monitoring weather and climate data have been under threat. In March, NASAfired its chief scientistand eliminated more than a dozen other senior positions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which collects global climate data, firedhundreds of probationary employeesin February and officials said officials they hadplans to shrink its work forceby nearly 20 percent. Projectsfocused on polar regions lost managers who oversee researchwhen the National Science Foundation laid off about a tenth of its work force.</p><p>When asked about the cuts, Dr. Meier noted that groups in Europe and Japan also monitor global sea ice.</p><p>“It’s not like there’s not going to be any knowledge of what’s going on in the Arctic, regardless of what happens in the U.S.,” he said</p><p>“But I, and I think all of us here at N.S.I.D.C., are focused on the data and our research and doing our best to serve the public by keeping people informed on what’s happening in the polar regions.”</p><p></p><p>Austyn Gaffneyis a reporter covering climate and a member of the 2024-25Times Fellowshipclass, a program for journalists early in their careers.More about Austyn Gaffney</p><p>Advertisement</p>

        <p>Signal Leak</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Supported by</p><p>Men and women who have taken to the air on behalf of the United States expressed bewilderment after the leak of attack plans. “You’re going to kill somebody,” one pilot said.</p><p>ByHelene CooperandEric Schmitt</p><p>Reporting from Washington</p><p>The intelligence breach was bad enough, current and former fighter pilots said. But Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s refusal to acknowledge that he should not have disclosed sensitive information about when American fighter pilots would attack sites in Yemen, they said, was even worse.</p><p>On air bases, in aircraft carrier “ready rooms” and in communities near military bases this week, there was consternation. The news that senior officials in the Trump administration discussed plans on Signal, a commercial messaging app, for an impending attack angered and bewildered men and women who have taken to the air on behalf of the United States.</p><p>The mistaken inclusion of the editor in chief of The Atlantic in the chat and Mr. Hegseth’s insistence that he did nothing wrong by disclosing the secret plans upend decades of military doctrine about operational security, a dozen Air Force and Navy fighter pilots said.</p><p>Worse, they said, is that going forward, they can no longer be certain that the Pentagon is focused on their safety when they strap into cockpits.</p><p>“The whole point about aviation safety is that you have to have the humility to understand that you are imperfect, because everybody screws up. Everybody makes mistakes,” said Lt. John Gadzinski, a retired Navy F-14 pilot who flew combat missions from aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf. “But ultimately, if you can’t admit when you’re wrong, you’re going to kill somebody because your ego is too big.”</p><p>He and other pilots said that each day since Monday, when The Atlantic published an article about the chat disclosures, had brought a stunning new revelation. First came the news that Mr. Hegseth had put the operational sequencing, or flight schedules, for the F/A-18 Hornets targeting the Houthi militia in Yemen on March 15 in the unclassified Signal group chat, which included several other senior officials.</p><p>“We intentionally don’t share plans with people who don’t need to know,” said one Navy F/A-18 pilot, who has flown frequently in missions in the Middle East. “You don’t share what time we’re supposed to show up over a target. You don’t want to telegraph that we’re about to show up on someone’s doorstep; that’s putting your crew at risk.” He and several other current and former pilots spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals from the Pentagon and from allies of President Trump.</p><p>But then came Mr. Hegseth’s initial response to the disclosures. He attacked Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic editor, as a “so-called journalist,” and sought refuge in a semantic argument, saying that he had never disclosed “war plans.”</p><p>So on Wednesday, The Atlantic published the actual text of what he had written, at 11:44 a.m. the day of the attack, in the group chat: “1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package),” Mr. Hegseth texted, some 30 minutes before it happened. “1345: ‘Trigger Based’ F-18 1st Strike window Starts (Target Terrorist is @his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME).”</p><p>This text was two hours in advance of the strikes.</p><p>Mr. Hegseth added: “1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package).” And then, “1536: F-18 2nd Strike Starts — also first sea-based Tomahawks launched.”</p><p>That text gave almost three hours’ notice.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Hegseth called his disclosure a “team update” to “provide updates in real time, general updates in real time” to keep Trump national security officials informed.</p><p>But details of military operations are usually kept so secret that even the service members taking part in them are “locked down.” That sometimes means they are not allowed to speak to others who do not have a need to know, let alone tell people about the plans, the fighter pilots interviewed said. In aircraft carrier “ready rooms,” where flight squadrons spend their time when they are not in the air, crews burn instructions to destroy them.</p><p>“It’s important to understand the degree that OPSEC is involved in every aspect of your life on an aircraft carrier,” said former Navy Capt. Joseph Capalbo, who commanded a carrier air wing and two F/A-18 squadrons, in a reference to operational security. “Red Sea ops are conducted in complete silence — no one is talking on the radio. Because everything can be heard by somebody.”</p><p>A former Air Force fighter pilot, Maj. Anthony Bourke, added: “When you disclose operational security, people can get killed.” He said that “these things are not taken lightly. I have never met anybody in the military who does not know this.”</p><p>Mr. Hegseth, a former Fox News weekend host, served as a National Guard infantryman.</p><p>Cmdr. Parker Kuldau, a former Navy F/A-18 pilot, called Mr. Hegseth’s disclosures, and subsequent response to them, “infuriating.”</p><p>“It’s so beyond what I would expect from anyone in the military,” said Commander Kuldau, who also flew combat missions in the Middle East. “The idea that the secretary of defense, who should know better, has done this, is just mind-boggling.”</p><p>Senior Defense Department officials and military analysts say that the Houthis possess air defenses, provided by Iran, that can target American warplanes.</p><p>“The Houthis have received several types of Iranian surface-to-air missiles designed to be capable of engaging fighter jets, including at high altitudes,” said Fabian Hinz, a military analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.</p><p>Indeed, Houthi rebels for the first time fired surface-to-air missiles at an F-16 fighter jet on Feb. 19, a senior U.S. official said. The missiles missed the fighter. The Houthis have shot down several slower-flying U.S. Air Force drones.</p><p>The Trump administration has insisted that none of the information on the chat was classified, and Mr. Hegseth and other officials have said it was not a “war plan.”</p><p>Sean Parnell, the Pentagon spokesman, said in response to a New York Times inquiry that the Signal chat “referenced by The Atlantic was not a forum for the official planning and execution of military operations — which also involved Joint Staff and Joint Force leadership.”</p><p>The chat included Vice President JD Vance; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; the national security adviser, Michael Waltz; and others, but not the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Christopher Grady, the highest-ranking military official.</p><p>Mr. Parnell said that “military leadership are frequently not included in political meetings.”</p><p>Vice Adm. Kevin M. Donegan, a former F/A-18 pilot who served as commander of U.S. naval forces in the Middle East, also pushed back on the idea that aviators’ safety had ever been at risk from the disclosure of information on the March 15 attacks.</p><p>“Assuming the timeline and information reported is true, the likelihood of anything getting to anyone who could have done anything in such a short time was very low,” Admiral Donegan said. “In the end our planes did not get shot down and no U.S. service personnel were injured or died.”</p><p>But one former senior Defense Department official with military experience said Mr. Hegseth’s text describing launch times and the type of strike aircraft was, indeed, classified information that could have jeopardized pilots’ lives if it had been released or obtained.</p><p>A former Navy F/A-18 squadron commander also said that pilots flying combat missions would have considered the contents of Mr. Hegseth’s text classified information. Revealing the details in text was “extremely cavalier,” the former pilot said.</p><p>Had the Houthis learned the precise time of strikes and that they would be conducted by carrier-based attack planes in the northern Red Sea, they could have repositioned and prepared air defenses that have already shot down several remotely piloted American drones, the former Navy pilot said.</p><p>Although Mr. Hegseth has dismissed the risks to the Navy pilots flying those attack missions, videos released by U.S. Central Command tell a different tale.</p><p>Some of the F/A-18 Hornets shown taking off from the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea were armed with 500-pound and 1,000-pound bombs that could only be dropped well within range of the Houthis’ air defenses.</p><p>Greg Jaffe and John Ismay contributed reporting.</p><p></p><p>Helene Cooperis a Pentagon correspondent.

        <p>Advertisement</p><p>Supported by</p><p>The Tejano music icon was fatally shot by the founder of her fan club, who has been serving a life sentence in Texas. On Thursday, a panel denied her first attempt at parole.</p><p>ByAdeel Hassan</p><p>A panel in Texas on Thursday denied parole for the woman who killed Selena, a 23-year-old trailblazing Mexican American singer who was making it big in the popular music scene. The decision came a few days shy of the 30th anniversary of the killing, which shocked her fans and spurred a cultlike following.</p><p>Yolanda Saldívar, the woman who fatally shot her, was the founder of Selena’s fan club; she killed Selena after a confrontation in a motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, on March 31, 1995. A jury convicted Ms. Saldívar of first-degree murder, and she was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.</p><p>Ms. Saldívar’s case had gone into the review process approximately six months before she was to first become eligible for parole this Sunday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole said in a statement. She won’t be eligible for parole for five more years.</p><p>“After a thorough consideration of all available information, which included any confidential interviews conducted, it was the parole panel’s determination to deny parole to Yolanda Saldivar and set her next parole review for March 2030,”the statement said.</p><p>The panel cited the violent nature of the killing as the reason for its denial.</p><p>“The record indicates that the instant offense has elements of brutality, violence, assaultive behavior or conscious selection of victim’s vulnerability indicating a conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others, such that the offender poses a continuing threat to public safety,” the statement said.</p><p>When she was killed, Selena had just come off a Grammy Award win. She was on the verge of making a breakthrough that could have brought her songs about heartbreak and new love to wider Spanish- and English-speaking audiences.</p><p>“Selena was a once-in-a-generation artist,” Maria Garcia, the host and creator of the podcast “Anything for Selena,” said on Thursday. “She revolutionized music, fashion and body politics in the U.S.”</p><p>Here’s why Selena’s case was drawing attention from fans across the country, and more about her legacy.</p><p>Selena Quintanilla Pérez was born in Lake Jackson, near Houston, in 1971. She began singing professionally when she was nine years old. She, along with her family band, Selena y Los Dinos, wasone of the biggest actsin Tejano music. Tejano, also known as Tex-Mex, is a modern blend of Mexican- and European-influenced polkas and guitar music. She later married Chris Perez, a neighbor who was the lead guitarist in Selena y Los Dinos.</p><p>Selena was the reigning queen of the Tejano music world at the time of her death. Her 1993 album, “Live,” won best Mexican American album, making her the first female Tejano artist to win a Grammy. Her album “Amor Prohibido” (“Forbidden Love”) sold 400,000 copies in the United States and many more in Mexico. Everything she sang came from personal experience.</p><p>Selena made her film debut, in “Don Juan DeMarco,” exactly one week after she was killed. She was also about to release her first English-language album, “Dreaming of You.” When it was released, it sold 175,000 copies on the first day, a record at the time for a female vocalist.</p><p>“When someone passes, one often hears that they lit up a room or that they had a heart of gold,” Ms. Garcia said. “But with Selena, those ideas were demonstrably true. Speak to anyone who knew her well and it’s clear this was an extraordinarily generous person with a magnetic charisma.”</p><p>Ms. Saldívar, a registered nurse, was the founder of Selena’s fan club and a manager of Selena Etc., a boutique and beauty salon. Ms. Saldívar, 34, was fired after Selena’s family accused her of embezzling money.</p><p>Selena went to pick up financial documents, which Ms. Saldívar had in her room at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi, trial testimony showed.</p><p>After an argument,Selena was shotin the back with a .38-caliber revolver in the room. She ran and collapsed and died in the nearby lobby.</p><p>Ms. Saldívar — during a 10-hour standoff with the police said, “I didn’t mean to do it. I didn’t mean to kill anybody.” She told officers that she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.</p><p>A jury in Houston took less than three hoursto convict herin October 1995.</p><p>The Recording Academygave herits lifetime achievement award during its Grammys telecast in 2021. Recently, there has also beena Netflix seriesand apodcastto introduce her to a new generation as well as a nostalgia trip for millions of longtime fans.</p><p>She described her music in an interview in 1994 with the San Jose Mercury News. “It’s got polka in it, a little bit of country, a little bit of jazz,” she said. “Fuse all those types of music together. I think that’s where you get Tejano.”</p><p>There was a surge of Hispanic artists after Selena made singing in both English and Spanish much more popular with mainstream American audiences. One of those artists was Jennifer Lopez, who found her initial fame playing Selena in the 1997 film “Selena.” That film made Selena a household name north of the border, and showed that cross-cultural identity was no barrier to commercial success.</p><p>“Dreaming of You,” the English-language album that she was working on when she died, went to the top of the Billboard 200 chart three months afterward, selling three million copies in the U.S. It featured the hits “I Could Fall in Love” and “Dreaming of You.”</p><p>In 2017, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Selena crossed most consequential borders: cultural, ethnic, geographical, linguistic and musical.</p><p>Ms. Garcia said that Selena’s image became a shorthand for Latino identity.</p><p>“An attack on her is perceived as an attack on a collective, a people. Latinos feel protective of her legacy. Because it is also our legacy, our cultural patrimony. ”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Adeel Hassanis a reporter and editor on the National Desk.

    <h1>With Car Tariffs, Trump Puts His Unorthodox Trade Theory to the Test</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

        <p>Tariffs</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>With sweeping auto levies, the president is putting his beliefs about tariffs into practice on the global economy. Economists aren’t optimistic.</p><p>ByAna Swanson</p><p>Ana Swanson is based in Washington and has written about international trade for over a decade.</p><p>President Trump and his supporters have clashed with mainstream economists for years about the merits of tariffs. Now, the world will get to see who is right, as the president’s sweeping levies on automobiles and auto parts play out in a real-time experiment on the global economy.</p><p>In Mr. Trump’s telling, tariffs have a straightforward effect: They encourage companies to move factories to the United States, creating more American jobs and prosperity.</p><p>But for many economists, the effect of tariffs is anything but simple. The tariffs are likely to encourage domestic car production over the long run, they say. But they will also cause substantial collateral damage that could backfire on the president’s goals for jobs, manufacturing and the economy at large.</p><p>That’s because tariffs will raise the price of cars for consumers, discouraging car purchases and slowing the economy, economists say. Tariffs could also scramble supply chains and raise costs for carmakers that depend on imported parts, reducing U.S. car production in the short term.</p><p>They could also lead to retaliation on U.S. car exports, as well as other products American companies send abroad, leading to damaging global trade wars.</p><p>On Thursday, global stock markets fell, with auto stocks hit hardest, as investors absorbed the scope of Mr. Trump’s plans. Shares in General Motors, which imports many of its best-selling cars and trucks from Mexico, were down roughly 7 percent in midday trading. Stellantis and Ford shares were also lower. European shares closed lower Thursday, with carmakers suffering the worst losses.</p><p>As automakers and economists scrambled to rework their growth forecasts, America’s allies slammed Mr. Trump for imposing tariffs, saying the levies would destabilize the global economy. Several vowed to retaliate.</p><p>Brad Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the tariffs were likely to lead to more domestic auto production in the long run. But getting there would be “really disruptive,” he said, and costly to both American consumers and the U.S. economy.</p><p>Mr. Setser said foreign automakers would be unlikely to give up on the U.S. market, and that brands like Toyota, Hyundai and Mercedes could end up making more cars in the United States to avoid paying the tariffs. In the shorter run, however, higher prices could convince some American consumers not to buy cars at all. That, along with disruptions in supply chains that run through Canada and Mexico or depend on foreign parts, could actually cause U.S. auto production to fall in the near term, he said.</p><p>Nearly half of all vehicles sold in the United States and 60 percent of all parts used in auto factories are imported. Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, predicted that automakers could see costs rise by $6,700 per vehicle sold.</p><p>“You could, because of the disruption along the way, have something that looks like a cyclical downturn in the auto sector, with layoffs, with lost jobs, even in places that will attract new investment and grow over time,” Mr. Setser said.</p><p>“This is a fairly risky move,” he added.</p><p>Economists also said the approach is likely to have downsides not just for foreign automakers like Toyota and Mercedes, but also for U.S. brands.</p><p>Jim Reid, a research strategist at Deutsche Bank Research, noted that it was not just overseas auto stocks that had tumbled, but also those for General Motors, which assembles just over half of its cars purely in the United States, he said. “So the pain is happening domestically as well as abroad.”</p><p>“The more you listen to the current U.S. administration, the more you appreciate that they are prepared to sacrifice near-term market performance and economic growth if it’s required to meet their longer-term objectives,” Mr. Reid said.</p><p>Economists have also questioned Mr. Trump’s assertions that tariffs will bolster economic growth, investment and hiring, suggesting that they could do the opposite.</p><p>In a note on Thursday, economists at Barclays Research said they had revised their forecasts and now expected global and U.S. growth to slow considerably from 2024 levels. “But if worst-case outcomes on tariffs are realized, even those forecasts may end up being too optimistic,” they wrote.</p><p>Marc Giannoni, the chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said that uncertainty over the direction of trade policy would encourage businesses to hold off on making new investments in factories and hiring more workers in the coming months.</p><p>“We expect businesses to hire less in the next few months,” he said. “Businesses that are pausing the investment decision are likely also to pause the hiring decision. So we see a lot of reduction in demand for labor.”</p><p>Mr. Trump has denied that the tariffs would have much negative effect, instead pointing to multiple company announcements of new investment in the United States. In addition to introducing additional tariffs on imports from China, Canada and Mexico in the last few months, Mr. Trump is planning to announcemore tariffsnext week, which he has said will make the global trading system more fair.</p><p>Speaking at the White House on Thursday, the president said that “business is coming back to the United States so that they don’t have to pay tariffs.”</p><p>“A lot of companies are going to be in great shape because they’ve already built their plant, but their plants are underutilized, so they’ll be able to expand them inexpensively and quickly,” he said of the automakers. He added that, “others will come into our country and build, and they’re already looking for sites.”</p><p>Mark DiPlacido, a policy adviser at American Compass who served in the Office of the United States Trade Representative in Mr. Trump’s first term, said he believed the tariffs would incentivize “a lot more investment in the American auto industry.”</p><p>“As the White House indicated, we’re at a point where 75 percent of the content of American vehicles are made abroad and imported here,” he said. “Reshoring more of that industry and investing in industry and workers is a welcome step.”</p><p>He acknowledged that there could be “disruptions and potentially short-term price increases” in the interim, but said that similar protections in the past had helped revive the auto industry.</p><p>But others say that carmakers could wait on making investments to see whether the tariffs will last. Though Mr. Trump said Thursday that they would be permanent and the White House said that no exclusions would be granted, both foreign countries and companies appeared to be hoping that the president would relent.</p><p>“Although he’s been pretty clear he intends to, we know from previous experience we shouldn’t assume these things are a done deal until they really are,” said Jennifer McKeown, the chief global economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>Anticipation of the tariffs is already rippling through the auto industry. Kit Johnson, a customs broker with John S. James Co. in Savannah, Ga., who helps car manufacturers with their importing, said he had been on the phone with customers all morning on Thursday, and there was “a big scramble right now to figure out what to do.”</p><p>The tariff pronouncements in the last few weeks had made it difficult for his clients to plan. “Every announcement that comes out, there’s planning sessions, they’re running different models to figure out what the financial impact will be,” he said. “It’s been one thing after another.”</p><p>Mr. Johnson said he believed the tariffs were “counterproductive.” He said that many companies wanted to invest to manufacture more in the United States, but that tariffs would “put a financial strain on them” as they tried to do so. “It’s kind of a Catch-22.”</p><p>Valerie Benton Smith, a senior sales associate at Bill Black Chevrolet Cadillac in Greensboro, N.C., said that she was bracing for the tariffs, and that higher prices and shortages of car models at dealerships “could hurt tremendously.”</p><p>She said the tariffs had been introduced suddenly, and that businesses were not set up to meet customer demand using all-American cars and parts. “I really think better planning needs to be done,” she said. “There’s just a lot of domino effects to this.”</p><p>The other main question is whether tariffs will spiral into bigger trade wars. Mr. Trump said on social media early Thursday that he would punish the European Union and Canada if they tried to work together to fight back against his tariffs.</p><p>“If the European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA, large scale Tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had!” Mr. Trump wrote.</p><p>Foreign leaders responded angrily to the tariffs, though none immediately imposed tariffs in response.</p><p>Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, said his country would introduce additional retaliatory tariffs on the United States but they will not be finalized until Wednesday, when Mr. Trump plans to introduce his so-called reciprocal levies.</p><p>“We will respond forcefully,” Mr. Carney said. “Nothing is off the table to protect our workers and our country.”</p><p>President Emmanuel Macron of France said Thursday that he had told Mr. Trump during a discussion the day before that tariffs were “not a good idea,” and said that Europeans would respond by reciprocating in hopes of getting the U.S. president to reconsider.</p><p>Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, told reporters, “We are always going to protect Mexico.” The Mexican government would issue “an integral response” to all U.S. tariffs — which so far also include levies on steel and aluminum — hitting the country on April 3, she said.</p><p>Economists predicted that the tariffs could be particularly devastating for Canada and Mexico, which have been integrated into the North American auto supply chain for decades.</p><p>Flavio Volpe, the president of the Auto Parts Manufacturers’ Association of Canada, called tariffs “a really blunt instrument.”</p><p>“One million cars in Canada a year are made by American manufacturers with 50 percent American parts and 55 percent of American raw materials and he’s ready to push them off a cliff to make a point no one understands,” Mr. Volpe said of Mr. Trump.</p><p>Reporting was contributed by Danielle Kaye, Ian Austen, Liz Alderman and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega.</p><p>Ana Swansoncovers trade and international economics for The Times and is based in Washington.

        <p>TrumpAdministration</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Supported by</p><p>As the Trump administration threatens to strip accrediting bodies of their power, many are scrambling to purge diversity requirements.</p><p>ByEllen Barry</p><p>The American Psychological Association, which sets standards for professional training in mental health, has voted to suspend its requirement that postgraduate programs show a commitment to diversity in recruitment and hiring.</p><p>The decision comes as accrediting bodies throughout higher education scramble to respond to theexecutive ordersigned by President Trump attacking diversity, equity and inclusion policies. It pauses a drive to broaden the profession of psychology, which is disproportionately white and female, at a time of rising distress among young Americans.</p><p>The A.P.A. is the chief accrediting body for professional training in psychology, and the only one recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. It provides accreditation to around 1,300 training programs, including doctoral internships and postdoctoral residencies.</p><p>Mr. Trump has made accrediting bodies a particular target in his crusade against D.E.I. programs, threatening inone campaign videoto “fire the radical Left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics” and “accept applications for new accreditors.”</p><p>Department of Justice officials have pressured accrediting bodies in recent weeks, warning the American Bar Associationin a letterthat it might lose its status unless it repealed diversity mandates. The A.B.A.voted in late Februarytosuspendits diversity and inclusion standard for law schools.</p><p>The concession by the A.P.A., a bastion of support for diversity programming, is a particular landmark. The association has made combating racism a central focus of its work in recent years, and in 2021 adopted aresolutionapologizing for its role in perpetuating racism by, among other things, promulgating eugenic theories.</p><p>Aaron Joyce, the A.P.A.’s senior director of accreditation, said the decision to suspend the diversity requirement was driven by “a large influx of concerns and inquiries” from programs concerned about running afoul of the president’s order.</p><p>In many cases, he said, institutions had been instructed by their legal counsels to cease diversity-related activities, and were worried it might imperil their accreditation.</p><p>“The Commission does not want to put programs in jeopardy of not existing because of a conflict between institutional guidelines” and accreditation standards, Dr. Joyce said.</p><p>He would not describe the tally of the March 13 vote, which followed about three weeks of deliberation. “Nothing about this was an easy decision, and not taken lightly,” he said. “The understanding of individual and cultural diversity is a core facet of the practice of psychology.”</p><p>The commission opted to retain another diversity-related standard: Programs must teach trainees to respect cultural and individual differences in order to treat their patients effectively. In reviewing each standard, the commission weighed “what may put programs in a compromised position” against “what is essential to the practice of psychology that simply cannot be changed,” he said.</p><p>Kevin Cokley, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, said he was “absolutely devastated” to learn of the A.P.A.’s decision on a psychology listserv this week.</p><p>“Frankly, I think the decision is really unconscionable, given what we know of the importance of having diverse mental health providers,” Dr. Cokley said. “I don’t know how the A.P.A. can make this sort of decision and think that we are still maintaining the highest standards of training.”</p><p>He said he thought the A.P.A. had acted prematurely, and could have waited until it faced a direct challenge from the administration.</p><p>“I think that there is always a choice,” he said. “I think this is a classic example of the A.P.A. engaging in anticipatory compliance. They made the move out of fear of what might happen to them.”</p><p>According the data from the A.P.A., the psychology work force is disproportionately white. In 2023, more than 78 percent of active psychologists were white, 5.5 percent were Black, 4.4 percent were Asian and 7.8 percent were Latino. (The general population is around 58 percent white, 13.7 percent Black, 6.4 percent Asian and 19.5 percent Latino.)</p><p>The demographic breakdown of graduate students in Ph.D. programs, in contrast, is more in line with the country. According to 2022 data from the A.P.A., 54 percent of doctoral students were white, 10 percent were Black, 10 percent were Asian and 11 percent Latino.</p><p>John Dovidio, a professor emeritus of psychology at Yale and the author of “Unequal Health: Anti-Black Racism and the Threat to America’s Health,” said the A.P.A.’s focus on diversity in recruiting had played a major part in that change.</p><p>“It really is something that departments take very, very seriously,” he said. “I have seen the impact personally.”</p><p>A memorandum announcing the decision describes it as an “interim action while awaiting further court guidance” on Mr. Trump’s executive order, which was upheld by a federal court of appeals on March 13. The order, it says, “is currently law while litigation is pending.”</p><p>Cynthia Jackson Hammond, the president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation, which coordinates more than 70 accreditation groups, said it is “unprecedented” for such bodies to receive direct orders from the government.</p><p>“The government and higher education have always worked independently, and in good faith with each other,” she said. “Throughout the decades, what we have had is a healthy separation, until now.”</p><p>The federal government began taking a role in accreditation after World War II, as veterans flooded into universities under the G.I. Bill. Accrediting bodies are regularly reviewed by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, which advises the Secretary of Education on whether to continue to recognize them.</p><p>But government officials have never used this leverage to impose ideological direction on higher education, Ms. Jackson Hammond said. She said diversity in recruitment remains a serious challenge for higher education, which is why the standard is still so commonly used.</p><p>“If we think about what our institutions looked like before,” she said, “that might be a barometer of what it’s going to look like if there’s not attention paid.”</p><p>Ellen Barryis a reporter covering mental health for The Times.More about Ellen Barry</p><p>Advertisement</p>

For three consecutive days, hundreds of peoplehave marchedthrough the town to demand the end both of the war and of Hamas’s 18-year-old rule over Gaza — public protests that have spread to a number of other towns in the battered enclave.</p><p>“Hamas needs to go away,” said Ahmad al-Masri, 26, a resident of Beit Lahia who helped call for the demonstrations. “If it doesn’t, the bloodshed, the wars and the destruction won’t stop.”</p><p>While most of the demonstrations have been small, they represent the boldest challenge to Hamas’s authority by Palestinians in Gaza since the Hamas-led attack on Israel of October 2023 and the ensuing war, which has reduced cities to rubble.</p><p>They also embody the frustration of Palestinians who are again living throughdeadly and ear-shattering bombingafter Israel and Hamas failed to reach an agreement to extend the cease-fire. They make clear that at least some Palestinians have put aside their fears about potential retribution by Hamas, which has governed Gaza with a heavy hand.</p><p>“We don’t have anything to lose,” said Mr. al-Masri. “We have already lost our lives, homes and money.”</p><p>Before the 2023 attack, Hamas brutally clamped down on Palestinians protesting the miserable living conditions in Gaza and conducted reconnaissance on protest organizers. But during the latest protests, Hamas’s internal security forces have largely refrained from cracking down. That, analysts said, was likely a reflection of both Hamas’sdelicate position with Gazansand its reduced ability to mobilize forces under the threat of Israeli airstrikes.</p><p>“How can it confront this movement? With force? That would cause even greater anger,” noted Akram Atallah, a Palestinian analyst from the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya. Fearful that Israel could try to kill security officers, Hamas may not be able to deploy them, he added.</p><p>But on Thursday, Hamas operatives wielding batons barred media coverage of the demonstration in Beit Lahia. The protest, which included hundreds of people, still went ahead.</p><p>Hamas still has a base of supporters in Gaza. Some of them have remained quiet while protests have taken place this week, while others have tried to cast doubt on social media about the motives behind the protests, alleging they were serving foreign agendas, without providing credible proof.</p><p>The first protest took place in Beit Lahia around 4 p.m. on Tuesday. The night before, community members sent around a message calling on residents to take to the streets.</p><p>“The square is calling on you,” said a screenshot of the message, shared with The New York Times. “Enough of wars. We want to live in peace.”</p><p>The message came shortly after Avichay Adraee, the Arabic-language spokesman of the Israeli military, posted an order for people to evacuate from Beit Lahia on his social media accounts. Not long after, an airstrike pounded into the town, residents said.</p><p>Asked about the strike, the Israeli military said it was operating against Hamas’s military capabilities, without addressing the specific case. Israeli has accused Hamas of operating within civilian areas in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack.</p><p>In interviews, protesters said that they hoped Hamas would give up its control over Gaza and remove any reason for Israel to continue to carry out attacks, forcing an end to the war.</p><p>“We can’t accept that all of us should die for them to stay in power,” said Sharif al-Buheisi, 56, a resident of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza who participated in a protest on Wednesday. Mr. al-Buheisi is an activist in Fatah, Hamas’s rival, and served as an administrator at Al-Azhar University in Gaza City before the war.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said that Israel would not end the war until Hamas’s military wing and government were dismantled, while Hamas has expressed willingness to give up control only of civilian government, not its arms.</p><p>For Mr. al-Buheisi, an important element of the protests was to push back on the idea — one held by some Israelis — that all of Gaza supported Hamas and terrorism.</p><p>“We’re affirming that we are a people that love life and our children,” he said.</p><p>The protests included the participation of mukhtars, local leaders in towns and villages who hold sway with large parts of their communities, demonstrators said. Before the first march in Beit Lahia, a number of young people approached mukhtars to secure support for the initiative, according to Mr. al-Masri and Hassan Saad, another resident of the town. They offered their blessings.</p><p>“We’re saying we want to live in dignity,” said Hisham al-Birawi, 64, a mukhtar in Beit Lahia. “We want to live like anyone else.”</p><p>Nader Ibrahim contributed reporting.</p><p>Adam Rasgonis a reporter for The Times in Jerusalem, covering Israeli and Palestinian affairs.More about Adam Rasgon</p><p>Advertisement</p>

Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday.</p><p>ByMatthew Cullen</p><p>The Trump administration announced today that it would lay off about 10,000 employees at the Health and Human Services Department and reshape it under the priorities of the health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Together with previous buyouts and resignations, the agency — which provides oversight of medical care, food and drugs —will have seen its staff shrink by nearly a quarterin the early months of the administration.</p><p>The major reduction will cut especially deep at two agencies within the department that have been in Kennedy’s sights: the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both are expected to lose roughly 20 percent of their staff members from the latest cuts.</p><p>The restructuring is intended to bring communications and other functions directly under Kennedy. Stunned employees struggled to absorb the news, and some expressed concern that the cuts could threaten public health and safety.</p><p>The move continued President Trump’s effort to downsize the federal bureaucracy sharply. Another cutback that my colleagues reported today: A crackdown on FEMA, which has been targeted by Elon Musk,effectively froze billions of dollars in disaster grants.</p><p>Other cuts:The Justice Department is consideringmerging its drug and gun agenciesin a broader downsize.</p><p>When Trump announced yesterday that he would soon impose a 25 percent tariff on imported cars, he cast it as a way to bring factory jobs back to the U.S. Canada’s prime minister today described the levies as a threat to Canadian workers andpromised retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.</p><p>“We will respond forcefully,” Prime Minister Mark Carney said. “It is clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner.”</p><p>The tariffs wouldraise prices by thousands of dollars for American consumers, but it’s not yet clear whichmodels will be affected the mostand when prices will rise.

    <h1>Kennedy Turns to a Discredited Vaccine Skeptic for Autism Study</h1>

        <p>Advertisement</p><p>Supported by</p><p>David Geier has been hired as a senior data analyst at H.H.S. According to several people, he will examine any potential links between vaccines and autism that were debunked long ago.</p><p>ByChristina JewettEmily Baumgaertner NunnandSheryl Gay Stolberg</p><p>A steadfast figure in the anti-vaccine movement who has helped shape Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s thinking on a possible link to autism has joined his department to work on a study examining the long-debunked theory, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The new analyst, David Geier, has published numerous articles in the medical literature attempting to tie mercury in vaccines to autism. In 2012, state authorities in Maryland found that he had been practicing medicine without a license alongside his father, Mark Geier, who was a doctor at the time.</p><p>Maryland authorities also suspended Mark Geier’s medical license following claims that he endangered children with autism and exploited their parents, accordingto state records.</p><p>Federal judges have rejected their research on autism and vaccines as too unreliable to stand up in court.</p><p>David Geier’s new government role has stunned public health experts, who had already expressed concerns about Mr. Kennedy’s decisions to cancel a long-held vaccine meeting and to cut grants focused on understanding vaccine hesitancy.</p><p>In addition, David Geier’s involvement in government research heightens their fears that vaccine confidence could be further eroded, especially after Mr. Kennedy’s recentembrace of questionable alternative treatmentsfor measles during the sprawling outbreak in Texas.</p><p>“If we increase vaccine hesitancy and immunization rates go down further, we will see more vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks,” said Dr. Christopher Beyrer, director of the Duke Global Health Institute. “That’s how it works.”</p><p>Several experts said that appointing David Geier to work on a study of vaccine safety preordains the outcome — like having a basketball referee show up in one team’s jersey.</p><p>“You’d think you’d want a fresh eye,” said Edward L. Hunter, a former head of the Washington office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>“This isn’t a fresh eye. They have already published their results, and spending all this time and money is not going to help anyone. I am quite certain they’ll come to the same conclusion.”</p><p>An official with Mr. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment. Two White House spokesmen did not respond to a request for comment. David Geier did not reply to emails or calls requesting comment.</p><p>Mary Holland, chief executive of Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit Mr. Kennedy ran until his presidential bid, praised David Geier on its website on Wednesday, describing him as “a brilliant, extremely knowledgeable researcher with deep expertise on mercury.”</p><p>(Over the weekend, federal officialsordered the nonprofitto remove a mock C.D.C. web page suggesting a link between vaccines and autism.)</p><p>David Geier is listed in theDepartment of Health and Human Services directoryas a “senior data analyst.” News of his role in the agency was initially reported by The Washington Post.</p><p>Earlier this month, federal officialsannounced plans for a large studyto re-examine whether there was a connection between vaccines and autism. Mr. Trump has voiced support for H.H.S. officials who wanted to revisit the issue, citing increases in autism diagnoses in children over the decades.</p><p>About 1 in 36 children have an autism diagnosis, according to C.D.C. data collected in 11 states, compared with 1 in 150 children in 2000.</p><p>Many scientists believethe rise is due in part to increased awareness of the disorder and changes in how it is diagnosed by medical professionals, though genetic and environmental factors could be playing a role as well.</p><p></p><p>The Senate confirmed Mr. Kennedy largely because he won over the chairman of the Senate health committee, Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, who is a medical doctor and strong proponent of childhood vaccines.</p><p>Mr. Cassidy has said that further research into any supposed link between vaccines and autism would be a waste of money and a distraction from studies that might shed light on the “true reason” for the rise in autism rates.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Cassidy said he wanted confirmation of David Geier’s role, aside from news reports. He mentioned that he had breakfast with Mr. Kennedy on Thursday but said the topic did not come up.</p><p>At one of his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kennedy shot back at Mr. Cassidy, citing a studyfrom an ecosystem of vaccine criticsthat he said proved a connection between vaccines and autism.</p><p>David Geier comes from a similar circle of researchers. Along with his father, he played a formative role in Mr. Kennedy’s thinking.</p><p>Mr. Kennedy interviewed David Geier for anessayin 2005, “Tobacco Science and the Thimerosal Scandal,” in which he accused the C.D.C. of deliberately hiding vaccine data, under chapter headings like “Conspiracy” and “The Cover-Up.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy described the Geiers’ belief that thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines, was linked to childhood autism. The preservative has since been removed from most childhood vaccines but is still used in some flu shots.</p><p>In a Rolling Stone article called “Deadly Immunity,” Mr. Kennedy credited the Geiers with being among the few who had gained access to C.D.C. vaccine data, which he said they used to “demonstrate a powerful correlation between thimerosal and neurological damage in children.” (The magazine later withdrew the article, but did not elaborate.)</p><p>Almost a decade later, in Mr. Kennedy’s book, “Thimerosal: Let The Science Speak,” he paid homage to the Geiers, mentioning them nearly 250 times. He called them a “father-and-son team of independent medical researchers” who had “published extensively on the topic of thimerosal and its potential link to neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism.”</p><p>Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that the two had become “lightning rods of controversy in the vaccine safety debate.”</p><p>“The Geiers have published no fewer than thirteen epidemiological studies of the associations between Thimerosal and health effects in U.S. populations, employing accepted statistical practices,” Mr. Kennedy wrote in the book.</p><p>On a podcastin 2022, Mr. Kennedy credited the Geiers’ research for showing that vaccines “had nothing to do with” a decline in infectious diseases over decades. “It was all an illusion,” Mr. Kennedy said, attributing the decrease to improving sanitation and nutrition.</p><p>The Geiers’ work has been repeatedly discredited by other scientists and federal court decisions.</p><p>An extensive review of the purported link between vaccines and autism in 2004 by the Institute of Medicine, an elite group of doctors and researchers, panned the Geiers’ studies. The review found their work to be marred by flaws “making their results uninterpretable.”</p><p>The institute’s report on a connection with the measles shots said: “The committee concludes that the evidence favor rejection of a causal relationship between M.M.R. vaccine and autism.”</p><p>In 2011, the Maryland Medical Board accused David Geier of practicing medicine without a license alongside his father at a Rockville, Md., clinic for children with autism.</p><p>One mother of a 10-year-old boy with autism balked when David Geier reportedly ordered 24 different blood tests for her son.</p><p>His father, Mark Geier, lost his medical license in 2012. Records in that case indicate that both father and son promoted a theory that thimerosal caused autism.</p><p>State authorities found that the Geiers had offered treatment with puberty-blocking drugs. To some patients, they offered chelation, a procedure to remove heavy metals from the blood, records show. David Geier was assessed a $10,000 fine.</p><p>Judges have rejected the Geiers’ efforts to serve as experts on vaccine safety in court. Records show that judges challenged the father-son team’s billings for hundreds of thousands of dollars related to services they provided as experts for a specialized vaccine injury court.</p><p>The judges cited David Geier’s lack of qualifications, which include a bachelor’s degree in biology, and raised concerns about his father’s credibility.</p><p>Judge George L. Hastings Jr. said in 2016 that David Geier was not qualified to render an expert opinion in a National Vaccine Injury Compensation court case.</p><p>Judge Hastings said his report “is neither useful nor relevant, because he is not qualified as an expert concerning the matters he discusses.”</p><p>In a review of two Geier studies this week, Jeffrey S. Morris, director of the division of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, said he found what appeared to be a numerical sleight of hand that made it appear that vaccines caused a spike in autism.</p><p>“When I look at these two studies, they are so fatally flawed that I have serious concerns that any study that they’re going to design is going” to be rigorous enough, he said, “to yield valid results.”</p><p>To Mr. Hunter, formerly of the C.D.C., the decision to spend federal funds on a new study of a debunked theory would come at the cost of a meaningful discovery.</p><p>Since he became health secretary, Mr. Kennedy has presided over cutbacks involving research into nearly every aspect of health care and diseases. On Thursday, heannounced a massive reorganization and reduction in thework force from 82,000 to 62,000.</p><p>“To me, the big shame is that with budget cuts, we are not ramping up research into what is actually causing autism,” Mr. Hunter said. “And if you are worried about vaccine-preventable disease, this is such a clear setback.”</p><p>Michael Gold contributed reporting from Washington.

    <h1>University of Michigan to Scuttle Its Flagship D.E.I. Program</h1>

        <p>Advertisement</p><p>Supported by</p><p>Michigan, once at the forefront of school diversity efforts, is rapidly changing course amid campus pushback and broad scrutiny by the Trump administration.</p><p>ByNicholas Confessore</p><p>The University of Michigan will eliminate its central diversity, equity and inclusion program, the school announced on Thursday, seeking to overhaul an ambitious and expensive initiative that it had long cast as a model for American higher education.</p><p>Michigan — one of the most prestigious public universities in the country — had for years steadily expanded its D.E.I. efforts even as conservative lawmakers and activists in other states successfully campaigned to defund or ban such programs. But on Thursday, amid intensifying pressure on colleges from the Trump administration, Michigan said it would discontinue its diversity “strategic plan,” known as D.E.I. 2.0, and effectively dismantle the large administrative bureaucracy constructed to drive it through the university’s colleges and professional schools.</p><p>In a campuswide email, officials said Michigan would expand its existing prohibition on so-called diversity statements in faculty hiring, banning their use more broadly in admissions, promotions, awards and annual reviews. Michigan’s academic unitswill alsobe asked to “evaluate their web presence” to reflect school and federal guidance.</p><p>At the same time, the officials said, they planned to redirect funds toward expanded financial aid and student counseling, shifting resources into mental health, pre-professional guidance “and other efforts that strengthen community, promote a sense of belonging and expand accessibility.”</p><p>“These decisions have not been made lightly,” the university’s president, Santa J. Ono, and other top officials wrote in their letter. “We recognize the changes are significant and will be challenging for many of us, especially those whose lives and careers have been enriched by and dedicated to programs that are now pivoting.”</p><p>School leaders have beendebating whether and how to overhaulMichigan’s D.E.I. program since last spring. The Board of Regents signaled in December that changes were likely, arguing that the school’s expansive D.E.I. effort had failed to make it meaningfully more diverse or inclusive.</p><p>But Thursday’s announcement comes at a more charged moment, as the Trump administration mounts an all-out war on what it considers D.E.I. in both the public and private sectors. Through executive orders and administrative actions — and often operating under a vague and expansive definition of D.E.I. — President Trump has taken aim at an array of policies and programs in higher education, framing them as part of a pernicious and illegal spoils system for racial minorities.</p><p>Last month, the Education Department warned universities that it viewed any consideration of race in hiring or services to students — such as scholarships, housing and even graduation ceremonies — as a violation of federal law.</p><p>At the same time, the Trump administration has cited high-profile anti-Israel protests, including at Columbia University,to threaten the loss of federal grantsunder laws requiring that schools receiving federal money work to prevent racial, ethnic and religious discrimination. Michigan faced similar controversies before Mr. Trump was elected: Campus protests in Ann Arbor exploded after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as didcomplaintsfrom both Jewish and Muslim students that they had faced harassment or discrimination.</p><p>Universities have sought to navigate intense pressure from Washington with rising discontent among students and faculty, many of whom have urged school leaders to fight back harder against the Trump policies and resist the administration’s efforts to dismantle D.E.I. entirely. Across the country, some schools have closed down D.E.I. programs and scrubbed websites;others have rebranded them, hoping to avoid closer scrutiny.</p><p>Thursday’s announcement alluded to that pressure, citing some of Mr. Trump’s executive orders and a recent court decision supporting them. But school officials also pointed to dissatisfaction from some students and faculty, who had argued that they did not feel included in D.E.I. initiatives and that the programming “fell short in fostering connections among diverse groups.” In December, Michiganfired a senior D.E.I. administratorover accusations that she had made antisemitic comments.</p><p>Even before Mr. Trump took office, other Michigan students and faculty members began lobbying to preserve the existing D.E.I. program. Thousandssigned a petitionthis winter attesting to what they saw as the positive impact of Michigan’s D.E.I. efforts. Many said they agreed with the broad goals of the D.E.I. program; some Black students have argued that it should be strengthened, with a greater focus on the experience of racial minorities on campus.</p><p>Got a confidential news tip?The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.</p><p>As Mr. Trump’s inauguration approached, however, Michigan’s largest academic unit, the College of Literature, Science and Arts, quietly paused its D.E.I. planning process, according to an email shared with The New York Times, to avoid drawing more attention from the incoming administration. In February, D.E.I. officials at Michigan circulated talking points that reframed the program as an engine of economic growth for the state and emphasizing that it consumed a tiny portion of the university’s overall budget.</p><p>Jordan Acker, a Michigan regent, said in a statement that Thursday’s announcement was about making the school’s D.E.I. program work more effectively, not dismantling it in the face of outside criticism.</p><p>“The focus of our diversity efforts needs to be meaningful change, not bureaucracy,” Mr. Acker said.</p><p>School officials are likely to face intense pushback from some students and faculty members. As word of the decision began to spread across campus on Thursday, the head of the Faculty Senate, Rebekah Modrak, called an “emergency meeting” for faculty, students and staff on Friday. In an email to her colleagues, Ms. Modrak said university leaders “seem determined to comply and to collaborate in our own destruction.”</p><p>Michigan’s current D.E.I. program — one of the largest among major public universities in the United States — was started in 2016 amid concerns that the school had failed to attract and retain enough Black students and faculty. Since then,according to an investigation publishedby The Times Magazine in October, Michigan has spent roughly a quarter of a billion dollars on a wide range of D.E.I. initiatives aimed at improving both economic and racial diversity.</p><p>The majority of that money went to to salaries and benefits for D.E.I. staff across the university’s three campuses, according to an internal accounting prepared by Michigan’s D.E.I. office last year.</p><p>During roughly the same period, however, the proportion of Black students on campus did not substantially change. And in surveys, students reported a less positive campus climate than at the program’s start and less of a sense of belonging.</p><p>Some students and faculty complained that the school’s heavy emphasis on D.E.I. had chilled the intellectual climate on campus and led academic work to focus too much on questions of identity and oppression. According to onereport producedby Michigan’s D.E.I. office in 2023, nearly half of all the school’s undergraduate courses included what the office considered “D.E.I. content,” such as explorations of racial, ethnic or religious identity.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Nicholas Confessoreis New York-based political and investigative reporter for The Times and a staff writer at the Times Magazine, covering power and influence in Washington, tech, media and beyond.

Now those numbers are under scrutiny.</p><p>ByIan Austen</p><p>Reporting from Ottawa</p><p>As in many places around the world, Tesla sales in Canada have been falling for months, an apparent reaction to Elon Musk’s outsize role in the Trump administration and his repeated denigration of Canadian sovereignty.</p><p>Yet somehow, four Tesla- owned dealerships reported to the Canadian government that they sold an astonishing 8,653 cars during a single weekend in January — enough to qualify for 43 million Canadian dollars’ (about $30 million) worth of government subsidies under a program just before it expired.</p><p>Now the Canadian government wants to know exactly how the electric carmaker managed to move two cars a minute off its lots — a rate that assumes those four dealers had stayed open 24 hours from Jan. 10 to Jan. 12.</p><p>Those payments were frozen this month after Mark Carney became Canada’s prime minister and named a new transport minister who ordered officials “to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid.” The minister, Chrystia Freeland, said that “no payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid.”</p><p>The subsidy program has expired, but Ms. Freeland, taking aim at the Trump administration, said that if there was a new one, Teslas would not be eligible “so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”</p><p>Tesla’s gain was a loss for some of its competitors.</p><p>The company’s breathtaking flurry of sales claims for some of its dealers in Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec drained funds from the government’s rebate program, bringing it to a close before its scheduled March 31 end date. As a result, the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association estimates, 225 dealers selling other brands were unable to claim about 10 million in Canadian dollars, putting some of them in financial peril.</p><p>“When you’re looking at a 43 million dollar hit over a weekend, an investigation is definitely warranted,” said Huw Williams, a spokesman for the dealers’ association. “The level of transactions just does not make common sense.’’</p><p>Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The Toronto Star first reported the sales rush claims, which were posted on a government website that tracks rebate payments.</p><p>Under the government plan, which began in 2019, dealers deducted rebates of up to 5,000 Canadian dollars when they sold electric vehicles before reporting the purchase information — including buyers’ names and the vehicles’ identification numbers — to the government for reimbursement.</p><p>The torrent of Tesla claims started on Jan. 10 after Transport Canada warned dealers across the country that the program would run out of money before the end of March. By Monday morning, the account was empty and the program was closed.</p><p>About 1,000 dealers selling other brands submitted claims over that weekend but Tesla accounted for about 88 percent of the applications.</p><p>“How did Tesla magically know to hit that number?” Mr. Williams asked, referring to the draining of the rebate program’s remaining funds.</p><p>While some dealers stacked up claims before submitting them to the government, Mr. Williams said, the Tesla surge “doesn’t fit any pattern for Tesla going backwards.”</p><p>He also said that it was physically impossible for the four Tesla dealerships to keep thousands of cars on hand.</p><p>Mr. Williams said that Ms. Freeland told his group that dealers who missed out after Tesla emptied the fund would ultimately be reimbursed, but that how long that might take was unclear.</p><p>Tesla has become a particularsource of anger among Canadians since President Trump began imposing tariffs on Canada and calling for Canada to become the 51st state.

    <h1>Trump’s Tariffs Will Raise Car Prices, but It’s Too Soon to Know When</h1>

        <p>Tariffs</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Experts say the 25 percent import fee will make many cars more expensive, but it is not clear when, by how much or which models.</p><p>ByNeal E. Boudette</p><p>There is no doubt the tariffs that President Trump said he would impose on imported cars, trucks and auto parts next week will raise prices by thousands of dollars for consumers.</p><p>What is not clear is how soon those increases will kick in, how high they will go and which models will be affected the most.</p><p>The tariffs — 25 percent on imported vehicles and automotive parts — are supposed to take effect next Thursday. But many car dealers said they were putting aside the question of price increases for now to focus on ending March with a sales flourish in the month’s final weekend.</p><p>“I’m not really thinking about what to do about prices yet,” said Adam Silverleib, owner of a Honda store and a Volkswagen showroom in the suburbs south of Boston. “I’m trying to close out the month and move as many cars as I can.”</p><p>Mr. Silverleib also pointed out that Mr. Trump had announced tariffs before only to delay them just before they were to take effect. “We’ll see if anything transpires in the next 96 hours,” he said on Thursday.</p><p>Auto analysts estimate that the tariffs will add$4,000 or more to the pricesof many new vehicles that are assembled outside the United States. For some high-end models, such as fully loaded pickup trucks, prices could rise $10,000 or more.</p><p>But the full impact on retail prices could take some time to become clear.</p><p>One variable is the administration’s decision to exclude from the tariffs the value of components made in the United States that are used in cars assembled abroad. That could be significant for some cars and trucks that are made in Canada or Mexico with engines, transmissions or other major components from places like Michigan and Ohio.</p><p>General Motors makes its Chevrolet Blazer in Mexico with American engines. Conversely, Ford Motor makes pickup trucks in U.S. plants with engines made in Windsor, Ontario. Under the executive order that Mr. Trump signed on Wednesday, the value of the G.M. engine has to be deducted before the tariff on Mexican-made Blazers is calculated. And Ford is supposed to pay a 25 percent tariff for every engine it brings in from Ontario.</p><p>“It all depends on where the vehicles come from, how many parts are imported and how long it takes the government figure out how many parts are going to be tariffed,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, a research firm.</p><p>Automakers typically have enough vehicles in dealer stocks to last 60 or more days. Any imported vehicles currently in storage lots won’t be subject to the tariffs.</p><p>In the last several weeks, Ford has stockpiled Windsor-made engines in U.S. warehouses to build up a supply that was not subject to tariffs.</p><p>Most automakers are still trying to sort out exactly how to factor the tariffs into the prices they charge dealers. Some could increase prices only on imported models, or those that have many imported parts. Another option would be to raise prices moderately across all models, including those made domestically with domestic parts.</p><p>G.M., Ford and other automakers declined on Thursday to discuss their plans.</p><p>The competitive landscape could play a role in what course automakers choose. The Ford Escape, for example, is made in Louisville, Ky., and is not subject to tariffs. It competes with models that will be tariffed — such as the Toyota RAV4, which is assembled in Canada, and the Chevrolet Equinox, which is made in Mexico and Canada.</p><p>If Toyota and G.M. raise prices on the RAV4 and Equinox to cover the impact of the tariffs, they could lose customers to Ford.</p><p>Other automakers face different challenges. Volkswagen, for example, is set to introduce this spring a new version of its Tiguan sport utility vehicle, which is assembled in Mexico. Higher prices could dampen demand for the vehicle, leaving Volkswagen to reconsider pricing and manufacturing plans it developed over the past year.</p><p>Over time, the tariffs could have broader effects. In some cases, consumers could encounter shortages of certain vehicles. Mr. Fiorani said he would not be surprised if automakers reduced or even eliminated sales of some entry-level cars that generated modest profits for manufacturers and dealers.</p><p>Affordable models, like the Nissan Sentra, are assembled in Mexico, where workers make a lot less than their counterparts in the Midwest. Those low labor costs help make it possible for automakers to sell those cars in the United States for a profit.</p><p>“In most cases, the manufacturers of these models will be in positions where they will no longer be viable products,” Mr. Fiorani said.</p><p>Neal E.

        <p>TrumpAdministration</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The president said he wanted the New York Republican to stay in Congress to bolster the party’s slim House margin and protect her seat.</p><p>ByAnnie KarniandMaggie Haberman</p><p>President Trump on Thursday said he had asked Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, to stay in Congress rather than serve as ambassador to the United Nations, amid concern about the minuscule voting margin that Republicans hold in the House.</p><p>“There are others that can do a good job at the United Nations,” Mr. Trump wrote on his website, Truth Social, where he said it was critical for Republicans to hold onto every House seat they have. “Therefore, Elise will stay in Congress, rejoin the House Leadership Team, and continue to fight for our amazing American People.”</p><p>Mr. Trump hinted that he might make it up to Ms. Stefanik in the future with another position in his administration. But for now, he said, Speaker Mike Johnson was “thrilled” with the development.</p><p>It was a stunning turnaround for Ms. Stefanik, who was Mr. Trump’s first cabinet nominee and who had been expecting to be confirmed by the Senate in the coming days.</p><p>And it underscored the precarious position that House Republicans are in with such a narrow majority that they can afford few defections. Mr. Johnson had previously said he could not afford to lose Ms. Stefanik while he was maneuvering critical measures, including his party’s budget plan, through the House.</p><p>It also highlighted concerns among Mr. Trump and leading members of his party about their ability to win what should be safe Republican seats in districts like Ms. Stefanik’s solidly red region of upstate New York.</p><p>Ms. Stefanik had apparently expected her wait to be confirmed would soon be over. She has spent the past week on Instagram posting a nostalgic retrospective of her time in Congress as she prepared for her tenure there to end. And she participated in a farewell tour across her district in upstate New York.</p><p></p><p>Her nomination had been expected to move ahead after April 1, when two Trump-endorsed Republicans were expected to fill a pair of House seats in Florida that were left vacant after the departures of former Representatives Mike Waltz and Matt Gaetz of Florida. Both had resigned after Mr. Trump selected them to serve in his administration, though Mr. Gaetz later withdrew from consideration as attorney general amid resistance on Capitol Hill.</p><p>But there has been growing concern among Republicans in recent days about the special election to replace Mr. Waltz, the embattled national security adviser who has drawn criticism for his involvement in a leaked Signal chat about a military strike on Yemen, in which he included a journalist. What was supposed to be a safe seat has become a competitive race.</p><p>Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with his thinking who described it on the condition of anonymity, has been livid at Mr. Waltz for his role in inadvertently including the editor of The Atlantic in the high-level chat and at the apparent difficulty at holding his seat in Florida.</p><p>He did not want the same thing to happen with Ms. Stefanik’s departure.</p><p>“With a very tight Majority, I don’t want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise’s seat,” Mr. Trump said in his post.</p><p>Ms. Stefanik had been eager to join the cabinet and had not expected to stay for so long in the House, where she gave up a leadership position and had already let many longtime staff members go. She also has not been seated on any subcommittees.</p><p>Her focus has been on the next job, and she has been privately expressing frustration on the delay with her Senate confirmation hearing.</p><p>Ms. Stefanik attended the first Trump cabinet meeting. And when Mr. Trump addressed a joint session of Congress, she sat with the cabinet rather than her House colleagues.</p><p>On social media on Thursday, Mr. Johnson said he planned to invite Ms. Stefanik“to return to the leadership table immediately.” But it was not clear what position she would occupy. The person who holds her old job as conference chair, Representative Lisa McClain, Republican of Michigan, is not resigning, according to a person familiar with her thinking.</p><p>Annie Karniis a congressional correspondent for The Times.

    <h1>Unburying the Remains of the Third Reich</h1>

        <p></p><p>As the German right ascends, the nation is still grappling with its fascist past — and how to handle its remains.</p><p>A skull found at a grave containing around 1,000 bodies near Hungary’s border with Serbia and Croatia.Credit...Antoine d'Agata/Magnum, for The New York Times</p><p>Supported by</p><p>ByNicholas Casey</p><p>Nicholas Casey is a staff writer at the magazine. He traveled to five countries in Europe to witness the recovery and reburial of Germans who died in World War II.</p><p>When Daniel and Victoria Van Beuningen first toured their future home, a quiet villa in the Polish city Wroclaw, it had been abandoned for years, its windows sealed up with bricks. But something about its overgrown garden spoke to them. They could imagine raising chickens there, planting tomatoes and cucumbers. They could make something beautiful out of it, they thought — a place where their children could run and play.</p><p>They moved in knowing very little about what happened at the villa before World War II, when Wroclaw, formerly Breslau, was still part of Germany; or what occurred there during the war, when Soviet forces held the city under a brutal siege; or even what became of the house during the war’s aftermath, when hundreds of thousands of local Germans were forcibly resettled from what was now Polish territory. All their neighbors could tell them was that the villa had once housed a Communist newspaper.</p><p>Still, the couple wanted to know more, and their inquiries eventually led to the Meinecke family in Heidelberg, Germany, elderly siblings who said they were born in the home. Over a long afternoon, they showed the couple pictures of the place from happier times before the war, but they also offered the Van Beuningens a surprising warning: The couple might find the remains of some German soldiers buried in the garden. Maybe a few, maybe more; they couldn’t be certain.</p><p>The Van Beuningens didn’t quite know what to make of the claim, but it suddenly sounded more plausible when Daniel, digging a trench for a water pipe in his backyard, unearthed a Nazi-era helmet. It was around that time that Victoria received an unexpected knock on their door from, of all people, an archaeologist. His news unsettled the Van Beuningens even more — he had found documents that described an entire “war cemetery” located at their address. Could someone return to investigate? It was perhaps a coincidence of timing, but it was clear to the Van Beuningens that the answer had to be yes.</p><p>The archaeologist, it turned out, was contracted by a private organization in Germany, run largely by former military officers and little known to the public. The Volksbund, as the group was called, had an unusual mission: to find the graves of every German who died in the country’s many wars, and then give each a decent burial, no matter who they were or what they had done.</p><p>A team from the Volksbund descended on the Van Beuningen property with an excavator on a cold March day in 2023. Before long, the workers hit a layer of churned earth, a telltale sign that a grave lay below. The archaeologists paused to pull out trowels and paintbrushes so as to not to damage any bones. Victoria and her son leaned in to look as the diggers uncovered the remains of a young woman with a much smaller skull in her lap:a mother and child, just like us, Victoria thought. Her children, fascinated, asked if they could stay home from school the next day to watch. Their parents agreed, and all that week, the Van Beuningens looked on in astonishment at what emerged from the earth behind their home.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>There were old rusted objects like keys and earrings. A pince-nez. A gold wedding ring. A large chain, and on it a medallion inscribed with the name of Wilhelm Korn. When someone lifted the remains of a Wehrmacht soldier, a doll fell onto the ground, perhaps belonging to the dead man’s daughter. The workers carefully accumulated bones, then sent them away in labeled crates. Where the Van Beuningens had pictured a garden, or maybe a swimming pool, there was now only a series of mounds. The final body count was staggering: 128 people.</p><p>Staggering but — at least for the Volksbund — not exactly surprising. Europe, in some ways, is a vast cemetery, littered with the remains of two world wars that killed, by conservative estimates, some 56.5 million people. Many simply vanished into the rubble, while others were hastily buried in unmarked graves. As countries rebuilt after the war, most of these killing fields were simply paved over as Europeans sought to turn a new page — leaving the daunting task of finding the dead for future generations. Many countries around the world have an organization like the Volksbund, but nowhere is this work more fraught than in Germany, where memory and forgetting are constantly bound up in a struggle to confront — or avoid — a guilt that was so vast that many references to the country’s nationalist past remain taboo even today. Germany is a place where the flag is rarely waved outside soccer games and giving the Nazi salute can be punished with a prison sentence. Germany’s response in the lead-up to the Russia-Ukraine war was hampered because it didn’t want to be seen as a military force.</p><p>Yet even as the country has sought to avoid reminders of its history, the remains of that past keep turning up — the war graves of 8,000 to 12,000 Germans are uncovered each year. Bones have been uncovered by excavators digging parking garages in German villages and by telephone workers laying fiber-optic cable where battles took place in the 1940s. At the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, soldiers outside Kyiv were digging trenches when they came across the skeleton of a man. He was a German soldier who died during the last war fought there, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union some 80 years before.</p><p>Complicating matters is the rise of the far right in Europe and around the world. For the first time since World War II, extremist parties have become ascendant across the region, and in places like Italy, Austria, Hungary and the Netherlands, these movements mirror — and in some cases trace their roots directly to — the fascist groups that triggered the war. In Germany, the charge is being led by the Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, which in February’s snap election became the second-largest party in Parliament, nearly doubling its seats there.</p><p>AfD has reshaped the German discourse on issues like immigration and climate change. But it is the party’s approach to the old taboos of the war that have collided most squarely with German norms. AfD leaders now denigrate what they call a “cult of guilt” around how the Nazi past is taught in schools, and they have reached out to figures of the American right for help. Before the February election, the tech billionaire Elon Musk stumped for the AfD after giving a Nazi-style salute at President Trump’s inauguration. “Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great-grandparents,” he told a crowd of AfD supporters at a rally. Weeks later, at a security conference in Munich, Vice President JD Vance threw his support to authoritarian movements across Europe, tellingGerman leaders that there is “no room for firewalls” between extremist parties and the seats of power. The comment drew gasps in the room and a rebuke fromChancellor Olaf Scholz, who later said, “A commitment to ‘never again’ is not reconcilable with support for the AfD.”</p><p>The commitment to “never again” raises hard questions for the Volksbund, which confronts the idea of guilt — individual or collective — with every disinterment. “Sometimes we have truly evil perpetrators,” says Dirk Backen, who heads the organization. “In some cases, we know the biographies, and we know that probably if they had survived the war they would have been put on trial and executed.” But sometimes the organization will instead find itself seeking a grave for the disinterred bodies of German mothers and their children who were cut down by Soviet artillery fire or, in a grayer zone, the corpse of a conscripted teenage soldier who was forced at gunpoint to murder Jews. These cases can reflect the complexity of history, but — as I found after many months of reporting on the Volksbund and its own, sometimes embattled history — they can also obscure it.</p><p>Germany’s searchfor its fallen soldiers begins in a lonely office park a two-hour train ride from Frankfurt. On a fall day, I met Arne Schrader, a retired army reserve major who heads the exhumations department at the Volksbund’s headquarters near Kassel, an industrial city in central Germany. Kassel was once filled with medieval buildings, but after it became a wartime manufacturing hub of the Nazis, Allied bombers flattened it into rubble. That changing landscape after the war presented one of the biggest challenges to finding the dead, Schrader told me. An archival map might show the exact place where a group of soldiers were buried, based on the location of a local church or an old street plan. But what if that church is gone, the streets remapped? “Now it’s only just a field,” Schrader said. “Where do you even begin?”</p><p>The Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge — the organization’s full name translates roughly to the People’s League for the Care of German War Graves — was founded in 1919 as a private group to search for those lost in World War I. Members went door to door collecting change from war widows and their children, who hoped that the next time they heard from the Volksbund it would be with news about the fates of their loved ones. The Volksbund’s mandate is not just to find the bodies but also to decide where to put them — creating a kind of vertically integrated operation that first exhumes the dead, then reburies them, often in cemeteries it has established on the outskirts of towns, which the Volksbund cares for in perpetuity. Today it manages some 830 war cemeteries around the world, where 2.8 million Germans are buried. The Volksbund’s budget comes mainly from its members, many of them relatives of the dead. It leads tours of gravesites as points of departure to reflect on what participants would have done had they been in the shoes of the war’s victims.Die Toten verpflichten die Lebendengoes an old saying of the Volksbund — “the dead oblige the living.”</p><p>The sheer amount of remains unearthed, numbering in the millions of bones, makes DNA testing too costly, so researchers use other objects found with the skeletons as clues, like dog tags or letters from loved ones. As Schrader and I walked through the hall, we passed a collection of objects that survived the years alongside the bones of the dead: a rusted cross, a glass eye with a blue iris, a pocket watch with arms frozen at five minutes to 11.</p><p>Schrader produced a bottle that once held wine. It now contained a typewritten message with a name: Franz Tauber. He was born on July 16, 1918, and was a milkman before joining the war. Schrader asked a colleague to log into a database, but the results said the Volksbund had not yet found any descendants of Tauber. At the other end of the table sat hundreds of dog tags that were collected from exhumation sites, organized into piles of around a dozen. “Three hundred lives, sitting on a table,” he said. “Five hundred children left behind, maybe. Three hundred wives. Six hundred parents.” Schrader paused for a moment as his colleagues continued typing. “The question is: Why do we do this?”</p><p>He had not always been so philosophical, but when Schrader was a young lieutenant, he visited a Volksbund war cemetery in Belgium, the final destination of nearly 40,000 German soldiers, many of them the same age as Schrader and the rest of his paratrooper platoon. The stark reality of all those graves raised many questions for him about military violence and the moral culpability of those who fought. “What allows men to kill each other?” he asked himself. “What war can turn a nice, caring, family father in 1938 into a fighting machine in 1942 in Russia?”</p><p>Still, the living judge the dead. Very few families are interested in accepting the bones of Nazi ancestors when the Volksbund calls with the news of their discovery. Other groups have attacked the Volksbund’s work outright. In 2020, antifascist leaders began protesting when it became public that German officials had been attending ceremonies at a Volksbund graveyard in the Netherlands that held the remains of prominent Nazis, including Julius Dettmann, the SS officer who had Anne Frank arrested. They were joined by Jewish leaders who signed a petition calling the cemetery “the most racist and antisemitic place in the Netherlands.” The Volksbund brushes off such criticism: If Europe is to confront the damage done by its history of war, the group believes, then it must have places to remember the dead — including figures like Dettmann.</p><p>Some time after I returned from Germany, I looked up Arthur Graaff, the man who organized the petition against the cemetery. “Dead people need to be buried,” he said when I called him in the Netherlands. “You can’t just leave them lying there.” But the man who ultimately sent Anne Frank to her death? By offering him a tomb like anyone else, he said, the Volksbund had gone too far in its mission: It made Nazi dead look like the war’s victims, not its criminals, a goal that Graaff told me he suspected was behind the Volksbund’s desire to care for the graves.</p><p>I asked Graaff what he would do with the site if he were in charge. “I’d put an earthen wall around it,” he told me. “Let the brambles grow. That’s it.”</p><p>The Volksbund getsitsleads from a variety of sources, and sometimes the source is the person who buried the bodies. In May 2023, a 98-year-old named Edmond Réveil told his local newspaper that he had something to confess. At 19, he had been part of the Maquis, a guerrilla group that fought the Nazi occupiers in France. In the last days of the war, his squad captured a group of 47 German soldiers. Instead of taking them to a P.O.W. camp, Réveil said, his squad took the prisoners to the outskirts of a village called Meymac, told them to dig their own graves, then shot them all dead, along with a Frenchwoman believed to be a collaborator. Réveil said the members of the squad all swore that day never to speak about what they did. Now they were all dead but him. He wanted people to know what happened, and — perhaps most important for the Volksbund — he said he still knew exactly where the bodies were buried.</p><p>When I arrived that summer, the old man had already led the Germans to a site about a 15-minute drive from the center of Meymac. But the passage of time had transformed the putative killing field: The once-barren hills were now covered by a towering forest of Douglas firs, planted after the war. Still, the Volksbund felt good about the site. Its ground radar system, though unable to detect bones, had sighted what looked like bullet casings and the evidence of disturbed earth.</p><p>As the Germans went about their work, I went looking for Réveil. His confession was a big news story in Europe — at least one reporter had staked out his home. But by the time I arrived in Meymac, the frenzy had calmed, and Réveil agreed to meet me for lunch at the home of his friend, the village dentist. He walked in wearing a checkered newsboy hat and brushed off all attempts to help him to the table; aside from a slight stoop, he cut a dashing figure for a man nearing his 100th birthday. “So you want to hear the whole story?” he asked after finding his seat.</p><p>His resistance squad, he said, was commanded by a former French reservist whose nom de guerre was Hannibal. On June 7, 1944, the squad attacked the city Tulle, and the next day it took 55 prisoners. The squad gave the soldiers the chance to join the resistance, but only a few among them did, mainly Czechs and Poles who had been conscripted by the Nazis. But the matter of the 47 Germans remained. There was no one to turn them over to, and the squad was too small to keep them. “When an order was received,” he said, “you just had to execute.”</p><p>Réveil said he ran into Hannibal crying after he received the order from one of his superiors; the commander, the only fighter among the French who spoke German, had gotten to know their captives, some of whom grew up along the same border as he had. No one wanted to kill the Frenchwoman — a collaborator, they were told, from a village called Saint-Pardoux. They drew lots, and the task fell to a man whose last name Réveil remembered as Texier, the brother of a local carpenter. After the trench was dug, Hannibal ordered the Germans who had pictures of their families to have one final look at them. The men they were about to kill were fathers to some and sons to others, Réveil told me. The prisoners were shot once — and then a second time to ensure they were dead, the “coup de grâce,” in Réveil’s words.</p><p>“My life is novel,” Réveil told me finally. “I don’t wish you to go through what I went through.” He finished his dessert, and then his son drove him home.</p><p>As the days passed with little progress in the search, the Volksbund workers grew tense. Right-wing collectors were fueling an online market for Nazi-era paraphernalia, and the workers feared that looters might sneak into the site at night looking for trophies. At the same time, the village was growing weary of the international spotlight. Meymac’s role in resisting the Nazis seemed clearly heroic until Réveil’s revelation. Now some online commentators were saying he had perpetrated a massacre. One day while I was on my phone in Meymac, I came across a pamphlet on the internet that wanted to set the record straight. “Resistance fighters are the opposite of war criminals!” it said, criticizing the journalists who wrote about the killings for sensationalizing them.</p><p>Over coffee, Céline Kompa, the local reporter who published the first article about Réveil, told me about how the town reacted to the news. “A lot of people would have preferred him to be quiet, not to say anything,” she said. “And I thought it was extremely courageous of him to speak up.” France, it seemed, had its own taboo when it came to speaking about what its fighters did during the war. All sides had something to be guilty of, she said, and war brought out the worst in everyone. “This is like pulling a ghost out of a closet.”</p><p>By late August, a rumor began to spread around the village that the search was not going well. Few people thought Réveil could have concocted such a dramatic story from scratch, and in fact some elements had been corroborated; more likely, it seemed, the remains were in another spot nearby. Réveil’s secret had been buried so long that it might be impossible to ever unearth. Ten days after the digging began, the Volksbund issued a statement saying it had found old coins and bullet casings from the war, but there were no skeletons at the site. “Unfortunately, such setbacks are part of our work,” the statement said, “but we are not giving up and are looking for more information.”</p><p>Some of the Volksbund’sdiscoveries come together far more quickly. Last April, I got a call asking if I could fly to Budapest: The group had unearthed what it believed was a mass grave of around 1,000 remains, along a highway near Hungary’s border with Serbia and Croatia. The ground there was sandy, which meant the excavation was moving more swiftly than usual, and I would need to get there soon if I wanted to arrive before they finished.</p><p>The history of this particular mass grave began with the 50-day siege of Budapest by Soviet and Romanian forces at the end of the war. By then, Hungary was ruled by its own fascist regime, the Arrow Cross Party, which killed thousands of civilians as it fought alongside its Nazi allies during just five months in power. By the time the Soviets finally took the city, the fighting was not just on the streets but had descended into the sewers, and more than 150,000 people would die.</p><p>On a sunny day last spring, I pulled up to a lot near an abandoned barracks from Hungary’s Communist years. The bones of hundreds of men, both Germans and Hungarians, lay in an open pit. I stepped out of the car to the sounds of birds singing mixed with the clink of shovels digging into sand. The pit dropped 10 feet down, and a Hungarian soldier who was working with the Volksbund gestured for me to join him at the bottom. Behind the soldier, sticking out from a wall, an army of bones had risen: Where once there were men, now there were ribs, fragments of sternum, pieces of vertebrae and teeth, everything sticking out from the earth. On the ground, other soldiers sat with paintbrushes dusting off the bones and placing them into groups; femur with femur, hip with hip. A collection of skulls covered a table, tree roots springing from where there once were eyes.</p><p>The soldiers whose bones we were looking at — Wehrmacht soldiers and Hungarians who fought with them — had survived the Soviet invasion and been sent as prisoners of war to a camp in a town called Baja. But after they arrived there, a sickness, most likely typhus, began to spread among them. They had lived through a world war — the oldest among them had probably survived two — only to die at a camp, mostly in their bedclothes. The sun broke through the clouds, and the Hungarian soldier and I simultaneously spotted something twinkling in the sand. It was a dog tag. A crowd of Hungarians and Germans quickly crowded around to examine it. Part of the birth date on the tag, July 29, was clear, but the year was rusted beyond legibility. The name was Péter Virág — his last name meant “flower” in Hungarian, a soldier told me.</p><p>The day after the exhumation, several Volksbund officials took me to a cemetery outside Budapest where the remains of many Germans who died during the 1944 siege were being buried. It was a quiet site with hundreds of white crosses and a stone engraved with a quote from Albert Schweitzer — “The soldiers’ graves are the greatest preachers of peace.”</p><p>The presence of the cemetery on Hungarian soil seems to have been accepted by the locals, but elsewhere the Volksbund’s gravesites have stirred up controversy. As I started to look into other cemeteries the Volksbund managed, I came across many disputes over the graveyards, some going back decades, and similar to the one involving the tomb of Anne Frank’s tormentor in the Netherlands.</p><p>In one case, the residents of Costermano, Italy, had discovered that Christian Wirth, an SS officer known as Christian the Cruel for having pioneered Hitler’s gassing and lethal-injection programs, was buried at a local Volksbund cemetery along with two other top Nazi officials. The townspeople demanded that the remains be removed, but the Volksbund said it couldn’t disinter them because they were buried in a mass grave. Only after four years of protests by the residents — and a refusal by officials to bury more remains there — were the names of the men removed from the “book of honor” at the cemetery’s visitor center in 1992. In 2002, Israel’s official Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, objected before a Volksbund ceremony in Israel that honored Germans killed during army service, including SS officers; the event had to be postponed. The following year, the Volksbund proposed building a memorial for Germans near a cemetery in the Russian enclave Kaliningrad for victims of SS medical experiments. At one point, the bones of 4,300 German soldiers spent years sitting in a Czech factory that produced toilet bowls after a dispute with authorities who initially demanded that the Germans pay millions of dollars to bury them.</p><p>When I spoke about the controversies with David Livingstone, a historian at California Lutheran University who has researched the work of the Volksbund, he said that the group’s history may have something to do with how it behaves today. In West Germany, where the Volksbund was based, the task of purging former Nazis from their old positions stalled as the Cold War fight with the Soviets became Europe’s main concern. That allowed many former Nazis to find work at Volksbund, searching for their dead compatriots. Those men died long ago, Livingstone said, and the Volksbund was different today. “But the organizational culture is such that it’s been set by the people who were the founders in the 1950s and 1960s, specifically military veterans of the Third Reich,” he told me.</p><p>Livingstone told me about a personal tie to the search for the graves: In the early 2000s, he learned that his maternal grandfather was buried at the Volksbund cemetery in Costermano. According to a family legend, the grandfather, a sergeant, was killed in a mutiny by his own men when he wouldn’t abandon the Nazi cause, even after it was clear that the Germans had lost the war. Livingstone told me that he explained the situation to the Volksbund while researching a book about him and asked if it could give him all the documentation it had about how his grandfather’s body was found so that he might corroborate the story. “All of a sudden they started to get very evasive with me,” he said. “Long story short, they didn’t respond.” (The Volksbund told me that the exchange had been “extremely polite” but that their files “are internal working documents that the Volksbund cannot pass on.”)</p><p>Livingstone said there were limits to the Volksbund’s portrayal of the soldiers as casualties of the Nazi regime. “The narrative that they promote, from my research, is what I would call a ‘grand equivalency,’ that everybody was a victim. But you can’t put a Jewish victim that was torn from their home and a German citizen who was subjected to bombing by the Allies in the same category,” he said. “I think right now it’s really important to call this stuff out, because we’re sliding toward this illiberal if not authoritarian populist view of the world.”</p><p>One summer afternoonon a long car ride to Vienna with Dirk Reitz, the managing director of the Volksbund’s office in Dresden, I asked him what the rising tide of populism meant for his work. He took a second to answer. There was a debate over how the Volksbund should manage the interest of Germany’s far-right party, AfD, which had contacted Volksbund about hosting joint events. Reitz believed that as a nonpartisan organization, the Volksbund should try to engage with all the political parties in Germany.</p><p>But sometimes things didn’t go as planned, he said. Not long before, he and a colleague had been invited by an AfD supporter to make a presentation at an upcoming gathering. When they arrived, they found themselves in the middle of a battle re-enactment, like the ones done for the American Civil War. But this battle seemed to be from World War II, and some of the participants were wearing SS uniforms. The uniforms crossed a line for Reitz — he said he left the event immediately. Still, I asked him if he had ever confronted the AfD supporter about the uniforms. “We still have to have that conversation,” he told me.</p><p>Reitz kept driving through the flat landscape toward Vienna. Around sunset, the phone rang, and Reitz answered it, exchanging a few words with the caller before he hung up. I asked him who it was. “The man I told you about,” he said. “I told him now wasn’t a good time to talk.”</p><p>— Markus Meckel, Volksbund president until 2016</p><p>Even if the Volksbund is cautious in its dealings with AfD members, Germany’s far-right party is vocal about its support for the group and its mission. On the AfD website, a petition by its leader, Alice Weidel, lists funding the group as one of its legislative priorities, along with establishing a “National Day for Unborn Life” and a plan to block Gazan refugees from entering Germany. Jan-Phillip Tadsen, an AfD state parliament member in Germany’s northeastern Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, told me that he is both a Volksbund donor and that he likes to lay wreaths at its ceremonies from the AfD.</p><p>The Volksbund does have supporters across the political spectrum: Several Volksbund officials I talked to said their biggest political patrons belonged to the Christian Democratic Union, Germany’s center-right party. One Green Party member I contacted told me she supported the group because it promoted peace and was opposed to far-right extremism.</p><p>Still, the possibility that far-right extremists could co-opt the Volksbund is a concern for some, including its former leadership. “I fear this organization is at huge risk of being instrumentalized,” Markus Meckel, the Volksbund’s president until 2016, told me when I met him in Berlin. Meckel, a former Protestant pastor, grew up in East Germany, where the Communist regime refused to build World War II memorials because they were seen as inherently pro-Nazi — an approach Meckel said he didn’t agree with because it sidestepped the hard questions of history. When he came to lead the Volksbund in 2013, however, he said he was startled by the group’s emphasis on commemoration. “There was this attitude there of ‘Our poor boys; look at what happened to them in the battlefield,’” he said. For an organization so concerned with the past, the Volksbund had seemed to sideline the mantra of “never again.”</p><p>Meckel decided he would undertake a reform project at the Volksbund. After having a look at the materials being distributed by the group, he found most of them to be inappropriate — for example, commemoration books for dead Wehrmacht soldiers that told about their lives but left out any information on the crimes German soldiers committed, or Christmas cards sent to families who had donated that told “sad stories from the western front.” The fliers the Volksbund distributed at its cemeteries focused mainly on the architecture. “But there was nothing about the war, nothing about why the soldiers were even there,” he said. Meckel ordered the publications to cease until they could be rewritten. Meckel also told me that the Volksbund staff almost exclusively focused on identifying the graves of German soldiers and ignored civilian remains.</p><p>Before long, the new president was looking into the Volksbund’s finances. One concern was that with each year, there were fewer war widows still alive to make contributions, and the organization’s income was declining. But equally troubling, Meckel said, was that some of the remaining donors had very questionable backgrounds. In one case, Meckel found that a large contributor was actually an organization that he suspected was founded by SS veterans. The group now sent money through a charitable foundation to obscure the funding’s Nazi ties, Meckel told me. “The question is: Who is sponsoring this?” he said.</p><p>(When I approached the Volksbund about the matter, it identified the group as the Mutual Aid Organization of Former Waffen-SS, a group that was known by its German initials, HIAG, and was eventually dissolved after numerous controversies. The Volksbund confirmed that HIAG’s assets had been transferred to a foundation it worked with afterward. But the Volksbund said the Waffen-SS group “saw itself as an aid organization” and for this reason was free to donate.)</p><p>His frustration mounting, Meckel sought to set the record straight with a mission statement — a move that he hoped would be a first step to build momentum for bigger proposals. It turned out it would be Meckel’s last crusade at the Volksbund. His proposal sought to clarify the group’s stance on World War II, calling it a “racist war of extermination,” a standard description approved years before by the German Parliament that placed the blame for the conflict squarely on Germany. But many in the Volksbund’s rank and file balked. A group of reservists led the charge against Meckel, with one former general writing an article that called his proposal “downright nonsense” and dismissed the idea that the war was an extermination campaign as a “historical theory that requires factual proof.” Sometime in 2016, Meckel determined that his opponents had the votes to remove him and resigned. (In its statement, the Volksbund said Meckel had “fallen out” with the organization because he had “ignored decision-making processes within the association and did not involve the committees in his decisions, instead acting autonomously. This caused resentment within the association.”)</p><p>After Meckel went public about the resistance against his reforms, the Volksbund eventually approved “war of extermination” language similar to what Meckel was pushing for, though only after he was gone. Meckel told me he was shocked that it even had to be debated so many years after the war. But he was also skeptical that the wording made a difference in the end. “They might have approved their mission statement, but they didn’t change their behavior,” he told me. “How do we mourn and remember these soldiers without honoring them?”</p><p>The bones exhumed fromthe Van Beuningens’ garden in Wroclaw were set to be reburied, on a rainy September day, at a Volksbund cemetery on the outskirts of the city. To the 128 bodies, the Volksbund had added an additional 178 remains, mainly Nazi soldiers it found at other sites around the city. A total of 306 people would be interred that day, I was told, in a military-style ceremony that would include a trumpeter and a chaplain.</p><p>The Volksbund had also searched for relatives to attend but found only one who was alive. Still, that did not stop a crowd from coming to the services that afternoon: As I arrived, dozens of Germans filed out of rented buses, Volksbund rank and file who traveled more than three hours from towns in the conservative states Saxony and Thuringia. One group had brought a wreath with the logo of a group called Landsmannschaft Schlesien to Poland. The group, I learned afterward, was a so-called German homeland association that represented descendants of those expelled from that part of Poland after the Nazi regime’s fall. In recent years, its youth wing was expelled for having ties to a neo-Nazi political party.</p><p>Below us in the pits sat the remains to be buried. Each set of bones had been fitted into a tiny black coffin about two feet long, which in turn had been arranged in neat rows on the ground, each with a sprig of fir on top. They were divided between two massive pits, one for soldiers and the other for civilians — roughly half in each group.</p><p>I asked if I could meet the relative the researchers had located and was soon introduced to Irmgard Aust, whose grandfather, Gustav Hiller, was killed during the war’s last year at 61. Aust told me she was a Volksbund member herself; she had first seen them as a child in Bavaria where they collected donations in tin cans. When it called her, she thought it was after another contribution — instead, it said it had found her grandfather’s remains behind the villa. “I started crying,” she told me. “I got emotional.” Aust showed me a sepia portrait of Hiller, who looked out with sunken eyes, a middle-aged man who had already lived through one world war. Hiller didn’t fight for the Nazis, Aust said, but the regime trusted him with leading food distribution as Breslau fought on. Finally, in April 1945, Hiller was killed in an air raid.</p><p>Aust’s husband, Gotti, began to show more pictures, but at one point his wife asked him to stop. Gotti closed the photo album and looked up from it with a polite smile — it seemed we had reached something the couple didn’t want to be seen. I asked Aust what was in the last photos. She wouldn’t say.</p><p>Someone rang a bell signaling the beginning of the ceremony. A sprinkle of rain began to fall, and various officials took to the lectern, speaking about the war in Poland and the need for Germans to acknowledge their responsibility for their crimes. They spoke about Germany’s campaigns of extermination against minorities. In the crowd of Germans, I was one of few foreigners there that day — no Polish representatives spoke at the ceremony taking place in their country, even though some were invited.</p><p>And it was perhaps because of this environment that a new theme emerged — not guilt, but grief. Many said that despite the devastation that was inflicted by Germany, their families had been victims too and wanted closure of their own from the war. One spoke of a relative who died on Christmas Day in 1941. The military deacon told the story of his grandmother, who did not know whether to declare her husband dead after he went missing while fighting in Russia. “When we remember the dead in front of God, we don’t think about a mass of people — we think about single people: a name, a home, a family,” he said. “God of peace, we ask you for the people we have buried here today. We only know a few by name, but we trust for you they are not a number, but your children.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence as the trumpeter played. Later, men with shovels came and buried the 306 bodies for the second time.</p><p>The following month, I sat down with Backen, a former brigadier general who now serves as the Volksbund’s chief executive. There was something strange about the funeral to me, not just to see the ceremony done with military honors but to see Germans grieving as much for themselves as for their victims. I knew this was the natural response when people bury their dead; at the same time, it all seemed to break with some unspoken prohibition about how to remember these particular combatants. Certainly there was an acknowledgment at the funeral of the national guilt Germany still faced. But when it came to the responsibility of the family members who chose their path during the Nazi years — those “single people” in the words of the chaplain — “never again” was replaced by recollections like those Aust had for her grandfather about their positive individual qualities instead of their monstrous collective crime. Maybe it is harder for families to carry stories of guilt than for nations.</p><p>I asked Backen what other taboos might be changing in his country. Its distrust of the military was one, he said. “When I was a young soldier, walking down the streets of Hamburg, someone might spit on you, right at the bottom of your feet when he crossed your path,” he said. Now things were changing: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was showing that German attitudes about pacifism needed to be reconsidered. “It will not protect you from someone who intends to do you harm,” he said.</p><p>None of this was to excuse Germany’s past war crimes, he said. The Nazi regime destroyed its own country along with much of Europe. Among the dead that the Volksbund exhumed were not just drivers and cooks but also true mass murderers. Still, the question of guilt was a complicated one. Backen said many of those who were buried were only 19 when they died. “Now, with the wisdom of hindsight, people say, ‘They should have done this’ and ‘They should have done that.’ I often ask myself: What would I have done if I was in that position?”</p><p>He told me a story about his grandfather, who fought with the Wehrmacht only to be sent to a prisoner camp after Hitler’s defeat, where he faced abuse at Soviet hands before returning home. As a young boy in postwar Germany, Backen said he once came across his grandfather and great-uncle, both former soldiers, in the garden drinking coffee. The two men were in tears. “You don’t understand as a boy, but later as you grow older and mature, you start to understand why they were crying,” he said. “But my children? There are no experiences like this anymore.”</p><p>I remembered an email exchange I had with Serge Klarsfeld, an 89-year-old former Nazi hunter living in France who joined the protest over the graveyard of Anne Frank’s persecutor in the Netherlands. Klarsfeld’s family experience of the war was far different from Backen’s — his father was murdered at Auschwitz — and he now seemed frustrated that the graves issue was still up for debate so many years later. To him, the matter had been simple: “We protested because it was known that the German graves in that cemetery, in a country occupied by the German Army during the war, were mostly SS graves,” he wrote to me.</p><p>Backen did not see the matter of the graves as so black and white. “How do we judge someone today, who we probably can assume has done wrong in his life and has committed a crime? He was never given a trial. He never had the chance to defend himself, because he died,” Backen said.</p><p>For Backen, there seemed to be more room to discuss, more room for nuance and subtlety, when it came to the remains and to whom they belonged.</p><p>“I’m someone who has really no desire to see them as heroes,” Backen said of the Nazi bones the Volksbund exhumed. “But imagine them, even those who are perpetrators: Imagine them in your mind as maybe an 8-year-old boy standing in front of a Christmas tree — with, with shiny eyes and. … ” There was a pause. “Was he born as a monster? A perpetrator? No. He was made into that by someone.”</p><p>Read byMalcolm Hillgartner</p><p>Narration produced byTanya Pérez</p><p>Engineered byLance Neal</p><p>An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Tulle was attacked.

        <p>Advertisement</p><p>Supported by</p><p>In some ways, the prodigy now starring for Arkansas in the N.C.A.A. tournament is an urban basketball archetype. But this is not the same old story.</p><p>ByDavid Waldstein</p><p>The 5-year-old boy was a fixture on that New York City playground basketball court. Almost every day, he and his father would go to the Booker T. Washington schoolyard on West 108th Street. They played for hours, but his father, an accomplished New York City high school player himself, insisted they stay until the boy hit 100 shots — 25 from four different spots on the court.</p><p>“Hitting those shots wasn’t hard for him,” his father recalled. “It was harder to get him to leave.”</p><p>It is an origin story befitting a fabled basketball legacy, a string of point guard prodigies emerging from the playgrounds of New York City: Stephon Marbury, Nate “Tiny” Archibald, Dwayne “Pearl” Washington. That boy on West 108th Street had a cool nickname of his own: He is Johnuel “Boogie” Fland, and he might be New York City’s next great point guard.</p><p>Now a freshman at the University of Arkansas, the lowest-seeded team left in the N.C.A.A. tournament, Fland has a chance to prove that one of the most enduring basketball myths lives on.</p><p>“The New York City point guard is not dead,” said Kenny Anderson, the former Archbishop Molloy point guard from Queens, who played 14 years in the N.B.A. and is considered by some to be the best New York City high school player ever. “Boogie is keeping the line alive. He’s one of the best we’ve had in a long time.”</p><p>Fland helped the Razorbacks score the biggest upset of the tournament last week, when the 10th-seeded team beat No. 2 St. John’s in the second round. It was only his second game back after a two-month injury, but his third game is Thursday night, when Arkansas plays Texas Tech in the Sweet 16.</p><p>Nicknamed “Boogie” by his mother because, as a toddler, he loved to dance around the house, Johnuel Fland Jr. was born in the Bronx. He went to high school at Archbishop Stepinac in White Plains, and he led his team to last year’s elite Catholic high school championship. He was also named that season’s Mr. New York Basketball, the highest honor for a male player in the state.</p><p>His parents split when he was 4, and his father moved to Manhattan, so Boogie divided his time between the boroughs. He attended the Booker T. Washington junior high school in Manhattan and led the boys’ team to a championship.</p><p>By ninth grade, he was back mostly in the Bronx with his mother, closer to Archbishop Stepinac, where he immediately demonstrated a relentless desire to improve. Most mornings he was in the school gym at 6 a.m., and he would stay after practice into the evenings, while his grandfather patiently waited to drive him home.</p><p>“You’d hear his grandfather, ‘Can we leave now?’” said Pat Massaroni, his coach at Stepinac. “Boogie would say, ‘Just a few more shots.’”</p><p>Massaroni said that many players will show a similar dedication, but only sporadically. What set Boogie apart is that he did it consistently, his entire time at Stepinac.</p><p>Then, before his sophomore year, a remarkable thing happened. New York State legalized payments to high school athletes through Name, Image and Likeness legislation, which had only recently been granted to college athletes. Before that, student athletes were supposed to be amateurs, and they would lose all eligibility to play if they accepted even a penny. Now students can be paid by companies or individuals to wear their apparel and make commercial videos, and that’s what Boogie did.</p><p>The old days of under-the-table cash payments to high school stars or secret gifts to their parents were over. With the help of Julian Aiken, a sports management adviser, and a team of lawyers and financial types, Boogie legally incorporated himself as a business while still a sophomore, becoming one of the first high school players in New York to do so. And even though he played his ball in the suburbs, he was known in the city.</p><p>Fland vividly recalls the first time a stranger recognized him. He was waiting in line at a chicken joint near his home in the Bronx, and a boy said, “You’re Boogie Fland.” The kid asked for a selfie, and Boogie, who was a sophomore in high school, posed with him. He watched through the window as the boy ran outside to show the photo to his mother.</p><p>“I could see how excited he was,” Fland said. “It was a really good feeling, because you knew that the hard work was paying off.”</p><p>It was also becoming increasingly obvious that Boogie was headed for the N.B.A., and that often attracts all kinds of characters hoping to profit off the player. But Boogie and his family kept the circle tight.</p><p>“That’s when you realize that money can change people,” his mother, Shakima Smith, said. “People look at you differently and say you’ve changed. I’m the same person, but if I did change, that’s called growth. I have to look out for my kid. He’s still my baby.”</p><p>By playing for well-regarded high school and Amateur Athletic Union teams, Fland followed a path similar to the one taken by players like Anderson and Marbury, who was a sensation at Lincoln High School in Brooklyn in the 1990s. But he differed in that he almost never played at the playgrounds or summer tournaments, not even at Rucker Park, the legendary outdoor court in Upper Manhattan, where many of the greats put on memorable shows.</p><p>It is at these tournaments that so many New York players established their legend — playground stars like Joe Hammond and Earl “the Goat” Manigault, two fabulous players, known to the cognoscenti, who never made it to the N.B.A.</p><p>As tempting as it was to gain that kind of hoops cred, Fland did not want his career to peak in the playgrounds. For one thing, the flashy, one-on-one style that seemed baked into the DNA of New York point guards did not suit his game, which is based more on team success and fundamentals. His father recalled the time Boogie was offered $10,000 to play in a tournament in Long Island. He turned it down.</p><p>“I was thinking about the bigger picture,” Boogie said recently. “Playing in those tournaments is amazing, but that wasn’t me. It wasn’t easy. People would be like, ‘Just come play in this one game.’ But in New York, you’ve got to stay mentally strong. I’d rather work hard in the gym, watch film and do stuff that’s going to help me.”</p><p>When it came time for college, Fland again looked ahead. He chose the University of Kentucky because of its head coach, John Calipari, who is known for developing players for the N.B.A. When Calipari left Kentucky for the University of Arkansas last year, Fland followed him.</p><p>His college career began well. As a freshman, Fland started out as Arkansas’s second-leading scorer, with over 15 points per game, and led the team in assists. In December, he scored 20 points to lead Arkansas to a dramatic win over the University of Michigan. It was his first game at Madison Square Garden, with scores of family and friends and old Stepinac teammates in the stands.</p><p>But in January, Fland injured his thumb and needed surgery. It was doubtful he would play again during the season, but he still attended games and practices. His parents even went to games, especially his mother. And he never sulked, his teammates said.</p><p>“He still had that Boogie laugh that you hear down the hall,” said Jonas Aidoo, an Arkansas graduate student and forward on the team. “He’s a bright soul.”</p><p>Arkansas had a mediocre regular season, and with Fland considering the N.B.A., it looked as if his college career might end after only 18 games. But the Razorbacks squeezed into the N.C.A.A. tournament, allowing Boogie the time to get back in the action, even as a slightly rusty substitute off the bench. First, he went to Calipari and said he didn’t want to hurt the team by forcing his way back into the rotation. Relating the story near the team bus following Arkansas’s win against St. John’s in Providence, Calipari scoffed at that idea.</p><p>“We are advancing,” the coach said, “because Boogie is back, and he gives us eight guys.”</p><p>The season will end one way or another with this tournament, and then Fland may enter the N.B.A. draft, where many experts believe he will be chosen in the first round.

Boasberg said top officials, including the defense secretary, the national security adviser and the secretary of state, must preserve the messages they exchanged.</p><p>ByAlan Feuer</p><p>A federal judge in Washington on Thursday ordered several Trump administration officials who participated in a Signal group chat discussing the details of a pending attack in Yemen to preserve all of the messages they exchanged on the app from March 11 to March 15.</p><p>The decision by the judge, James E. Boasberg, came in response to a lawsuit filed this week by a nonprofit watchdog group American Oversight, accusing Mr. Trump’s national security team of violating federal records laws by using Signal — an encrypted commercial communications platform — to chat about the attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen.</p><p>The order by Judge Boasberg, who sits in Federal District Court in Washington, applied to top administration officials, including Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth; Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence; and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p>At a hearing in Federal District Court in Washington, Judge Boasberg made clear that he had issued his order to be sure that none of the Signal messages were lost, not because he had made a finding that administration officials did anything wrong.</p><p>American Oversight, which often seeks to pry loose information from the government under the Freedom of Information Act, has accused the administration officials of violating the Federal Records Act, which requires official communications by agency officials to be preserved.</p><p>The revelation that top Trump administration officials not only discussed a pending military strike on Signal, but also inadvertently invited a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, into the chat, has shocked the national security establishment. The lawsuit filed by American Oversight was in some sense a pre-emptive measure to ensure that the full record of what was said on the group chat was not deleted.</p><p>The Justice Department, in a filing on Thursday afternoon, said that one of the participants in the group chat, Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, had already turned over the version of the messages that was on his phone.</p><p>In the same filing, a lawyer at the Pentagon asserted that he had requested a full copy of the chat from Mr. Hegseth, but it remained unclear whether it had been turned over.</p><p>This is a developing story and will be updated.</p><p>Alan Feuercovers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J.

She did not say what type of cancer her husband had or how long he had been ill.</p><p>Mr. Sherman vaulted to stardom in the Western comedy series“Here Come the Brides,”making his debut in 1968 in the role of Jeremy Bolt, one of several brothers intent on finding companions for the lonely lumberjacks at their logging business in Seattle after the Civil War. From 1968 to 1970, the show ran for 52 episodes on ABC, helping to put Mr. Sherman in the public eye and on the covers of teeny-bopper magazines.</p><p>One of his first breaks came in the mid-1960s, when he was cast as a house singer on the variety show“Shindig!”which was also broadcast on ABC. And he landed cameos on two prominent sitcoms of the era. The first was“The Monkees,”with Mr. Sherman playing Frankie Catalina in a 1967 episode — a nod to another teen idol, Frankie Avalon. In 1971, he appeared in one episode of “The Partridge Family.”</p><p>But Mr. Sherman achieved his greatest success as a recording artist, with a collection of catchy hits about love and coming of age that associated him with a style known as bubble gum music.</p><p>His single “Little Woman” peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 list in 1969 and earned him a gold record.

Mr. Sherman’s performance led to his being introduced toJack Good, a producer of “Shindig!”</p><p>In the late 1970s and 1980s, Mr. Sherman made occasional appearances on television, including on “The Love Boat” and “Murder, She Wrote,” but he receded somewhat from the spotlight.</p><p>He later became an emergency medical technician and organized a squad of volunteer paramedics to work special events in Southern California.

        <p>TrumpAdministration</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Supported by</p><p>The discussions come as President Trump has taken aim at Wilmer Hale, another big law firm. Other major firms are said to be trying to cut deals with the White House.</p><p>ByMichael S. SchmidtBen ProtessMatthew GoldsteinJessica Silver-GreenbergandMaureen Farrell</p><p>The elite law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom has had discussions with President Trump’s advisers about a deal to avert the type of executive order that the White House has been imposing on many of its competitors, according to five people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.</p><p>The talks represent an extraordinary turn in Mr. Trump’s campaign against law firms and the legal system more broadly, marking what appears to be the first time that a major firm has tried to cut a deal with the president before he could issue an executive order. Recent orders targeting other law firms have restricted the work they can do with the federal government.</p><p>The Skadden discussions are also the latest example of how large law firms, afraid of a protracted battle with Mr. Trump, are eager to strike deals.</p><p>The White House has signaled that more firms are in the president’s sights to receive executive orders, particularly those that employ lawyers who have worked on investigations into Mr. Trump or on causes that his supporters object to.</p><p>On Thursday night, Mr. Trump took aim at an additional law firm, issuing anexecutive order suspending the security clearance for Wilmer Hale, a large firm that was once home to Robert Mueller III, the former F.B.I. director who served as special counsel on the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Mr. Trump.</p><p>Mr. Mueller returned to Wilmer Hale following the end of his investigation and formally left the Washington-based law firm in 2021.</p><p>The executive order blasted the firm for hiring lawyers who “weaponize” the legal system, engage in “partisan representations” and abuse its practice of providing free legal services to organizations.</p><p>What you should know.The Times makes a careful decision any time it uses an anonymous source. The information the source supplies must be newsworthy and give readers genuine insight.</p><p>In a statement, Wilmer Hale said, “We look forward to pursuing all appropriate remedies to this unlawful order.”</p><p>While Wilmer Hale vowed to fight the order, Skadden was not the only firm in discussions with Mr. Trump’s team, according to two people briefed on the matter, and that multiple deals could be announced in the coming days.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It is unclear how the talks got started or whether Skadden will ultimately reach an agreement with Mr. Trump. But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump hinted that such deals might emerge and boasted about his track record of bringing big law firms to heel.</p><p>“They’re all bending and saying, ‘Sir, thank you very much,’” Mr. Trump said, adding that law firms are saying, “‘Where do I sign? Where do I sign?’” Mr. Trump said in his retelling of the law</p><p>A spokeswoman for Skadden did not respond to several requests for comment. A White House spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>Although it is unclear precisely why Skadden drew the White House’s attention, there were recent signs that the firm could be next.</p><p>In a post on his social media platform, X, Elon Musk singled out Skadden’s work assisting in a lawsuit against Dinesh D’Souza, the right-wing media critic and political commentator.</p><p>“Skadden, this needs to stop,” Mr. Musk wrote in his post, referring to the firm’s work on behalf of a private citizen who said Mr. D’Souza had falsely accused him of ballot fraud in a documentary about the 2020 election.</p><p>The post was somewhat surprising because lawyers from Skadden represented Mr. Musk during his acquisition of Twitter in 2022.</p><p>The discussions between Skadden and the Trump advisers come one week after another prominent law firm, Paul Weiss, cut a deal with Mr. Trumpthat was widely criticized in the legal community as a capitulation to a brazen and possibly unconstitutional executive order.</p><p>Mr. Trump’s order against Paul Weiss, which has extensive ties to Democrats and anti-Trump causes, had gone so far as to restrict the firm’s lawyers from entering government buildings.</p><p>Mr. Trump agreed to drop the order in exchange for Paul Weiss’s commitment to represent clients no matter their political leanings and a donation of $40 million in free legal service to causes Mr. Trump has championed.</p><p>The leaders of Paul Weiss said that Mr. Trump’s order would have decimated their business — and thatrivals were looking to poachsome of their top lawyers. But the firm’s agreement appears to have emboldened the president and encouraged other firms to consider making their own deals.</p><p>The flurry of actions taken by Mr. Trump against law firms has, for the most part, been met with silence from industry leaders. Lawyers have been reluctant to speak out for fear of making their firm a target.</p><p>In this void, law school deans and bar associationshave issued statementsdenouncing the actions taken by the president and warning that punishing law firms because of whom they represent is a serious threat to the rule of law.</p><p>On Tuesday, Jenner & Block became the latest big law firm to receive an executive order. The order, like the ones against Jenner’s competitors, accused the law firm of engaging in “lawfare.” The order also singled out Jenner’s pro bono practice, claiming that the law firm had used it “to engage in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the United States.”</p><p>One of Jenner’s former partners, Andrew Weissmann, had worked closely with Mr. Muellerin his investigation of the ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia during his first term.</p><p>Skadden also founditself swept up in Mr. Mueller’s investigation into Russian potential interference in the 2016 election, though the issues had little connection to Mr. Trump. Mr. Mueller’s inquiry had focused on some of the lobbying work Skadden lawyers had done for Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.</p><p>So far, Perkins Coie is the lone law firm willing to go to court to fight Mr. Trump over one of his executive orders — and it is having some initial success.</p><p>In an order temporarily barring a major portion of Mr. Trump’s order from taking effect, a federal judge in Washington suggested that it was unconstitutional.</p><p>“I am sure that many in the profession are watching in horror at what Perkins Coie is going through,” the judge, Beryl A. Howell of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, said. She added, “It sends little chills down my spine.”</p><p>On Wednesday Judge Howell rejected a Trump administration motion that she recuse herself from the case. She said the disqualification motion was “rife with innuendo.”</p><p>Lauren Hirsch and Rob Copeland contributed reporting.</p><p>Michael S.

    <h1>Another Problem With That Signal Chat? The Messages Disappear.</h1>

        <p>TrumpAdministration</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act require officials to preserve communications related to government business.</p><p>ByLuke Broadwater</p><p>Luke Broadwater is a White House correspondent. He reported from New York.</p><p>The Signal group chat that senior Trump administration officials convened to discuss military strikes in Yemen has sparked outrage over the reckless way a journalist was mistakenly added to the group.</p><p>But open government experts have raised another concern as well: the rise in usage of disappearing messaging apps like Signal, which they say could become a way for officials to skirt the requirements of federal laws meant to preserve government records.</p><p>“It’s a huge problem,” said Anne Weismann, a George Washington Law professor who frequently acts as outside counsel for nonprofits who push for more openness in government. “If the secretary of defense is participating in a conversation about planning an attack, I think it’s hard to argue there’s any circumstance in which that would not be appropriate for preservation.”</p><p>Two federal laws — the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act — require officials to preserve communications related to government business. Agencies can comply with the law by instructing those using messaging apps to preserve chats through screen shots or other means.</p><p>Presidential records, which would include the communications of Vice President JD Vance, who participated in the Signal chat, must be permanently preserved. Many other federal records are considered temporary, but they must be preserved until the National Archives and Records Administration approves their destruction.</p><p>All of this affects what records the public can eventually see through Freedom of Information Act requests. If there is no record preserved, there is nothing to release.</p><p>The White House did not respond to a question about what guidance the Trump administration had given to top aides about preserving any messages they send or receive on Signal.</p><p>On Thursday, a federal judge heard arguments from the watchdog group American Oversight, which wants to order members of the Trump administration to preserve texts from disappearing messaging apps.</p><p>Amber Richer, a Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration, assured Judge James E. Boasberg that the government was taking steps to preserve messages from the Signal chat in question.</p><p>“These agencies are certainly working to fulfill their obligations under the Federal Records Act,” Ms. Richer said.</p><p>Judge Boasberg ordered the government to preserve all records in the chat, which took place from March 11 to 15. He said he wanted to see Trump administration develop record-keeping policies consistent with federal law.</p><p>In past administrations, national archivists have written letters to try toenforce the Presidential Records Actand the Federal Records Act. During the Biden administration, the National Archivesreferred an investigation into Mr. Trump’s handling of documents to the Justice Department.</p><p>Mr. Trump fired the nation’s archivist in February and appointed Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, as the acting archivist. Mr. Rubio was among those who participated in the Signal chat with disappearing messages.</p><p>“They have, in my view, completely co-opted NARA and the role of the archivist,” Ms. Weismann said.</p><p>Concerns over the rising use of Signal and other disappearing messaging apps are not new. They existed during the first Trump administration, when the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a lawsuit that claimed White House officials were using apps like Signal and Confide to delete messages in violation of the Presidential Records Act.</p><p>During the Biden administration, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agencyrecommended the use of Signal, writing that it was a “best practice” to “adopt a free messaging application for secure communications that guarantees end-to-end encryption, such as Signal or similar apps.”</p><p>But this week’s news thrust the messaging app to the attention of the public.</p><p>Top Trump officials had convened a Signal group chat to discuss airstrikes in Yemen, but Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, mistakenly addedJeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the group. In the chat, Mr. Hegseth disclosed specific operational details two hours before U.S. troops launched attacks against the Houthi militia in Yemen.</p><p>Some messages were set to delete automatically in one week or four weeks, Mr. Goldberg reported.</p><p>“There were legal obligations on the part of all of the members of that chat to fulfill their record-keeping responsibilities,” said Jason R. Baron, a professor in the College of Information at the University of Maryland.</p><p>He said systems to automatically preserve messages are simply not in place for apps like Signal the way they are for emails. When Congress updated the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act in 2014 to include electronic messaging, ephemeral apps were not used pervasively in government. The records laws leave it to individuals to take steps to ensure that messages are preserved.</p><p>“Automated email archiving is taken care of at most agencies because they’re under a mandate to preserve government records electronically,” Mr. Baron said. “Electronic messaging is under the same mandate, but it’s still the Wild Wild West in terms of compliance, since agencies have not generally taken steps to automate ways to preserve those records.”</p><p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Signal was an “approved app” for government use, and “the most safe and efficient way of communicating,” especially when people could not be in the same room.</p><p>“This is a first step in the right direction,” Chioma Chukwu, the interim executive director of American Oversight, said of the Trump administration’s pledge to preserve records. “But we’re going to have to keep going, because you can’t believe what the administration says. You have to watch what it does.”</p><p>Alan Feuer contributed reporting.</p><p>Luke Broadwatercovers the White House for The Times.More about Luke Broadwater</p><p>Advertisement</p>

    <h1>Trump Takes Government Secrecy Seriously. But Only When It Suits Him.</h1>

        <p>TrumpAdministration</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Supported by</p><p>News Analysis</p><p>In the Trump era, the definition of an official secret depends on whatever works best for the president.</p><p>ByPeter Baker</p><p>Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent, is covering his sixth presidency and reported from Washington.</p><p>As far as the Trump administration is concerned, there are government secrets and then there are government secrets.</p><p>Details sought by a federal court about amilitary flight of immigrantsthat landed many days ago with video cameras recording its arrival? Sorry, judge, too secret to reveal, even now long after the fact.</p><p>Details about an upcoming military strike against American enemies disclosed by the president’s top national security advisers on anunsecured group text chat? Not classified, not a breach of national security and not a big deal.</p><p>What constitutes an official secret in this new era in Washington, it turns out, seems to depend on who is asking and who is telling. The juxtaposition of two cases involving sensitive information in the same week reinforces just how situational President Trump’s approach to government secrecy can be.</p><p>And it illustrates Mr. Trump’s remarkable capacity for bending political reality to his will without worrying about facts or consistency. After all, this is a president who has made Canada and Europe out to be enemies not allies, who rewrote history toclaim that Ukraine started the war with Russiaand who sent lawyers to court to argue that Elon Musk is not really in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>This has become so common that the disparity in what constitutes a secret played out without much acknowledgment of the disparity. On the one hand, the Trump administration invoked the so-called state secrets privilege to defy a federal judge trying to determine whether its no-hearing, no-due-process deportation of immigrants was legal. On the other hand, Mr. Trump brushed off the stunning disclosure of a planned attack on Houthi militants on a group chat that inadvertently included a journalist on the commercial platform Signal.</p><p>“What’s baffling is the claim that pending military operations are not so sensitive after all, while the facts of a widely reported deportation that has already occurred cannot be disclosed,” said Steven Aftergood, who spent decades on government secrecy issues at the Federation of American Scientists. “It’s hard to take secrecy seriously as an instrument of national security when it is being manipulated so obviously for self-serving political ends.”</p><p>In both cases, the information at the heart of the issue is a time stamp. In the immigration case, Judge James E. Boasberg has ordered the administration to tell him what time the plane transporting Venezuelans deemed to be gang members took off from U.S. soil, what time it left U.S. air space, what time it landed and what time the migrants were officially transferred out of U.S. custody.</p><p>The judge wants those details to determine whether the administration illegally violated his order to turn the plane around. The administration has said that information is too sensitive to give to him.</p><p>In the case of the Signal chat, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave colleagues on the group chat (and the journalist mistakenly added to it) the precise time that U.S. warplanes and drones would strike the Houthis a couple hours beforehand.</p><p>Presumably, that information might have been of some use to those Houthis being targeted, had they known it. But the White House and Mr. Hegseth are essentially saying that that information actually was not all that sensitive.</p><p>“We have said all along that no classified material was sent on this messaging thread,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said at a briefing this week. “There were no locations, no sources or methods revealed and there were certainly no war plans discussed.”</p><p>She did not mention the time estimates. Instead, when pressed about them by reporters, Ms. Leavitt changed the subject and attacked the journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, and Democrats for making too much of the whole thing. She then assailed former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for the botched troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p><p>National security veterans in both parties scoffed at the contention that the details that Mr. Hegseth provided about the imminent strike were not classified during the group chat that also included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the national security adviser Michael Waltz and others.</p><p>“There is absolutely no way in which the information shared in that group chat was not classified at the highest levels,” said Oona Hathaway, a former Pentagon lawyer now at Yale Law School. “I’m frankly stunned that anyone would try to suggest otherwise. Such detailed information about an imminent military operation is precisely the kind of information that is most closely guarded.”</p><p>She added: “This is all the more absurd in light of the government’s assertion that the state secrets privilege permits it to withhold information from the district court about a plane of migrants that had already landed.”</p><p>While less sensational secrecy lapses have typically triggered serious investigations involving possible criminal liability, Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday seemed to suggest that she did not plan to pursue the issue.</p><p>Just last week, though, Ms. Bondi’s deputy, Todd Blanche, announced that the Justice Department was opening a criminal investigation into a leak to The New York Times about the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. In his announcement, Mr. Blanche said that the leaked information was “inaccurate but nevertheless classified.” How false information could be classified, he did not explain.</p><p>Mr. Trump has always viewed violations of national security secrecy through the lens of who is doing the violating. He won the presidency for the first time in 2016 at least in part by excoriating his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for using an unsecure private server to send email while in office. He led crowds in chants of “lock her up” and declared that if he were elected “no one will be above the law” when it comes to endangering government secrets.</p><p>But once he got to office, Mr. Trump regularly disregarded warnings about protecting government information. Heposted sensitive satellite imagery of Iranonline. He keptusing an unsecured mobile phoneeven after being told it was monitored by Russian and Chinese intelligence agencies. Hetore up official documentsand threw them to the floor despite laws requiring they be preserved, leaving aides to collect the pieces and tape them back together.</p><p>Most memorably, of course, Mr. Trump took classified documents when he left the White House in January 2021, storing them in a shower, an office, a bedroom and a ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago estate and defying a subpoena requiring him to return them. When the special counsel Jack Smith laterindicted himfor over his handling of secrets and conspiring to obstruct justice, Mr. Trump derided the case as partisan persecution.</p><p>When Mr. Biden was found to also have classified documents at his home in Delaware, however, Mr. Trump expressed outrage, even though Mr. Biden, unlike Mr. Trump, promptly reported the discovery himself, returned the documents and cooperated with investigators. “Trump was peanuts by comparison,”Mr. Trump declared at one point, referring to himself in the third person.</p><p>Even on Thursday, Mr. Trump’s team fell back on a whataboutism defense, insisting that the disclosure of a military operation in advance on a Signal chat was a nothingburger compared to Democratic transgressions.</p><p>“If you want to talk about classified information, talk about what was in Hillary Clinton’s home,” Ms. Bondi told reporters. “Talk about the classified documents in Joe Biden’s garage, that Hunter Biden had access to.”</p><p>In fact, investigators determined, none of the emails Mrs. Clinton sent on her private server had headings marking them as classified. Only after the fact did officials retroactively conclude that 110 emails in 52 email chains out of 30,000 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent or received.</p><p>That was enough to prompt an F.B.I. inquiry that, while it did not result in criminal charges, proved embarrassing enough that it helped cost Mrs. Clinton the presidency. Likewise, a special counsel investigation of Mr. Biden produced no charges but included the politically damaging characterization of the president as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” and “diminished faculties in advancing age.”</p><p>While Ms. Bondi did not seem troubled enough by the Trump team’s disclosure of attack plans to even initiate an investigation, her department went to court this week to protect the secrecy of information that could compromise the Trump administration politically and legally.</p><p>The flight data for the deportation of Venezuelan immigrants would help Judge Boasberg figure out whether the administration ignored his order to turn the plane around so that he could first determine whether the expulsion was legal.</p><p>Ms. Bondi’s department refused to comply, arguing in a brief that disclosure “would pose reasonable danger to national security and foreign affairs.” How that would be a danger once the flight was over was not entirely clear, but the administration included a declaration from Mr. Rubio saying that it would “erode the credibility of the United States’ assurances” to other countries “that information will be maintained in confidence.”</p><p>However, the government of El Salvador, which agreed to the Trump administration request to accept and imprison the Venezuelan migrants, was hardly trying to keep the matter secret. Indeed, it posted a video of the arrival. Hiding the time of the arrival did not seem a matter of concern.</p><p>In an example of a Washington oddity, the two cases converged in a way on Thursday when the Judge Boasberg, acting in a separate lawsuit filed in response to the attack plan group chat, ordered the Trump administration to preserve all Signal messages from March 11 to 15 to comply with federal records law.</p><p>“This administration is doing more to discredit national security secrecy than critics ever did,” Mr. Aftergood said. “There have always been abuses and excesses in official secrecy policy. But everyone accepted that there were also genuine secrets, including details of imminent military operations, identities of intelligence sources and so on.”</p><p>Peter Bakeris the chief White House correspondent for The Times.

    <h1>A Surprising Route to the Best Life Possible</h1>

        <p>Advertisement</p><p>Supported by</p><p>David Brooks</p><p>ByDavid Brooks</p><p>Opinion Columnist</p><p>Haruki Murakami was a mediocre student. Like a lot of people who go on to high achievement later in life, the future novelist had trouble paying attention to what the teachers told him to pay attention to, and could only study what he was interested in. But he made it to college, and a few credits before graduating he opened a small jazz club in Tokyo. After a ton of hard work, he was able to pay the bills, hire a staff and keep the place open.</p><p>In 1978, Murakami was at Meiji Jingu Stadium in Japan watching a baseball game and drinking a beer. The leadoff batter for his team, the Yakult Swallows, laced the ball down the left field line. As the batter pulled into second base, a thought crossed through Murakami’s head: “You know what? I could try writing a novel.”</p><p>He started writing after closing time at his jazz club and eventually sent a manuscript off to a literary magazine — so blasé about it that he didn’t even make a copy for himself in case the magazine lost what he had sent in. It won a prize and was published the next summer. He decided to sell the bar, which was his only reliable source of income, and pursue writing. “I’m the kind of person who has to totally commit to whatever I do,” he wrote in his 2008 memoir.</p><p>No longer doing the physically demanding work of running a bar, he started to put on weight. He decided to take up a sport, and running seemed like a good option: There was a track right by his house, it didn’t require fancy equipment and he could do it by himself.</p><p>He wasn’t lying when he talked about his tendency toward total commitment. By the late 2000s, he was running six miles a day, six days a week every week of the year, and had run in 23 marathons, plus many other long-distance races, an ultramarathon and some triathlons.</p><p>Even when he was young his times were not stellar, and he was miserable a lot of the time. The memoir, “What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,” is studded with sentences in which he describes his agony at one race after another: “As I ran this race, I felt I never, ever wanted to go through that again.” Or: “At around 23 miles I start to hate everything.” Or: “I finally reach the end. Strangely, I have no feeling of accomplishment. The only thing I feel is utter relief that I don’t have to run anymore.” Or: “It was draining physically, as you can imagine, and for a while afterward I swore I’d never run again.”</p><p>The first question that pops into my mind is: Why would he do something that regularly makes him miserable? But when you look around you see a lot of people out there choosing to do unpleasant things. I don’t just mean those adventure freaks who feel compelled to climb Mount Everest, walk across Antarctica or row the Atlantic — though all those things sound truly miserable. I mean us regular folks leading our regular lives.</p><p>All around us there are people who endure tedium to learn the violin, who repeatedly fall off stair railings learning to skateboard, who go through the arduous mental labor required to solve a scientific problem, who agree to take a job managing other people (which is truly hard) or who start a business (which is insanely hard).</p><p>My own chosen form of misery is writing. Of course, this is now how I make a living, so I’m earning extrinsic rewards by writing. But I wrote before money was involved, and I’m sure I’ll write after, and the money itself isn’t sufficient motivation.</p><p>Every morning, seven days a week, I wake up and trudge immediately to my office and churn out my 1,200 words — the same daily routine for over 40 years. I don’t enjoy writing. It’s hard and anxiety-filled most of the time. Just figuring out the right structure for a piece is incredibly difficult and gets no easier with experience.</p><p>I don’tliketo write but Iwantto write. Getting up and trudging into that office is just what I do. It’s the daily activity that gives structure and meaning to life. I don’t enjoy it, but I care about it.</p><p>We sometimes think humans operate by a hedonic or utilitarian logic. We seek out pleasure and avoid pain. We seek activities with low costs and high rewards. Effort is hard, so we try to reduce the amount of effort we have to put into things — including, often enough, the effort of thinking things through.</p><p>And I think we do operate by that kind of logic a lot of the time — just not when it comes to the most important things in our lives. When it comes to the things we really care about — vocation, family, identity, whatever gives our lives purpose — we are operating by a different logic, which is the logic of passionate desire and often painful effort.</p><p>Let me put it another way: We use cost-benefit analysis when we are operating in a prosaic frame of mind. But I don’t think anything great was ever accomplished in a prosaic frame of mind. People commit to great projects, they endure hard challenges, because they are entranced, enchanted. Some notion or activity has grabbed them, set its hooks inside them, aroused some possibility, fired the imagination.</p><p>The moment of enchantment can be so subtle and soft — a baseball player hits a double and Murakami contemplates writing a novel; he has a track by his house, so maybe he’ll take up running. But, unbidden, almost involuntarily, a commitment has been made — to some activity or ideal — a quiet passion has been inflamed. Some arduous journey has begun.</p><p>It is a great and underappreciated talent — the capacity to be seized. Some people go through life thick-skinned. School or career has given them a pragmatic, instrumental, efficiency-maximizing frame of mind. They live their life under pressure, so their head is down; they’re not open to delight, or open to that moment of rapture that can redirect a life. Others have a certain receptivity to them.</p><p>They are able to hear that still, soft voice inside: “Maybe I could write a novel.” They are sensitive, impressionable, enthusiastic, absorbent, hospitable. They are open to being surprised, and when that constructive disorientation happens, they stop and contemplate:What am I being called upon to do here?Most of our great journeys begin with a surprise. Wonder, Descartes observed, “is a sudden surprise of the soul.”</p><p>What are the kinds of experiences that can kindle a life-altering enchantment? Some people stumble across a group of people who just seem cool, who just seem to be doing something worthwhile. They think:I want to be like them.</p><p>Moss Hart was an unhappy boy living in the Bronx with an active fantasy life. One day he took the subway down to Broadway and saw theater people who were putting their fantasies onstage and longed to join their company. On that day a playwright was born.</p><p>Other people find their vocation through some contact with beauty — a future astronomer awed by the beauty of the universe, a future mechanic awed by the beauty of a smoothly running engine. When he was 3 Yehudi Menuhin went to a concert by the violinist Louis Persinger and then told his parents he wanted a violin for his fourth birthday. “I did know instinctively,” he reflected decades later, “that to play was to be.”</p><p>Sometimes a scientific career will begin with a small observation: “That’s strange.” When he was 4 Einstein noticed invisible forces in the universe controlling the needle of the compass he held in his hand — and invisible forces became his life’s work. Some people go into careers of public service because somebody says something to them that seems to them life-gripping and true.</p><p>When Tony Wagner was 22, he asked a disciple of Gandhi for his definition of revolution. The man replied, “Revolution is the dynamic process of transforming individual virtues into social values.” Wagner realized at once that teaching was his best contribution to that process, and he’s spent his career teaching in high school and college.</p><p>In all these cases there is a moment of ignition, something outside touching something deep inside, the opening up of new personal possibilities. I think of these as annunciation moments, moments when one is called, moments that prefigure so much of what happens in a life. “Where is your Self to be found?” the Austrian poet Hugo Von Hofmannsthal asked. “Always in the deepest enchantment you have experienced.”</p><p>We surround these moments with commencement address clichés — follow your passion, follow your heart. But those phrases are so vague that they don’t mean anything. I want to understand more precisely what happens when one is gripped by a controlling desire. How exactly does some fervent commitment grow, take over your life and induce you to take on voluntary pain?</p><p>***</p><p>I guess the process starts in mystery. Like falling in love, these ignition moments happen at the deepest layer of our unconsciousness — that dark region where interests ignite, desires form, the motivational core of our being. This is the part of myself I can’t see easily into. Why am I interested in astronomy but not geology? I don’t know. Why am I entranced by Rembrandt and left cold by El Greco? I don’t know. Why do I love her but not her? I don’t know. We can decide what we’ll order off life’s menu, but we can’t decide what we like.</p><p>Know someone who would want to read this? Share the column.</p><p>As in any kind of falling in love, it happens in the wildness of the heart. As in any kind of falling in love, it can start with a subtle prenotion, but it soon arouses amazing energies. As in any form of falling in love, it can lead to sublime irrationality. When you’ve fallen in love with a person, town or activity, it’s not because you calculated your way there; it’s because some flame was ignited by a force greater, darker and more passionate than your reasoning mind; it irradiates you, conquers you and demands obedience.</p><p>The next stage of any calling or vocation is curiosity. When you’re in love with someone, you can’t stop thinking about her. You want to learn all there is to know. Curiosity is the eros of the mind, a propulsive force. It can seem so childish. Throughout history people have been nervous around curiosity. You never know where it will take you. One of Vladimir Nabokov’s characters called it the purest form of insubordination. Curiosity drives you to explore that dark cave despite your fears of going down there. Curiosity is leaping ahead of the comfortable place you’ve settled and dragging you into the unknown.</p><p>In one of his novels, “1Q84,” Murakami described that kind of troublesome curiosity: “I’m looking at a map and I see someplace that makes me think, ‘I absolutely have to go to this place, no matter what.’ And most of the time, for some reason, the place is far away and hard to get to.”</p><p>Einstein argued that theoretical physics is so arduous that it can be driven only by a passionate curiosity. The scientist’s “religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law,” he wrote. Richard Dawkins wrote that “the feeling of awed wonder that science can give us is one of the highest experiences of which the human psyche is capable. It is a deep aesthetic passion to rank with the finest that music and poetry can deliver.”</p><p>Like any passion, curiosity has to be transformed from a raw instinct to a methodical skill. When they are at their best, schools teach students how to arouse and discipline their curiosity. The effectively curious people have cognitive enthusiasm (they like to explore mysteries and think about new things), cognitive confidence (they are brave enough to tackle hard problems) and cognitive complexity (they don’t settle for simple stereotypes).</p><p>It doesn’t take long to hit the next stage of the passionate life: the discrepancy. The seeker notices the vast discrepancy between what she knows about some subject and what she’d like to know, how good she is at some activity, and how good she wants to be. Whether it is ballet, engineering or parenting, the seeker is humble enough to see where she falls short, inspired enough to set a high ideal and confident in her ability to close the gap.</p><p>Wanting flows from a sense of discrepancy. Based on the work of various psychologists, we could say that there are at least four basic psychological needs: for autonomy, belonging, competence and meaning. Of those, the drive for competence doesn’t get enough press. No matter how trivial an activity might be, most people seem to feel an innate need to get better at it — whether it’s kids learning double Dutch, me just shooting baskets in the driveway or somebody else proud at how much better he’s getting at flipping pancakes. Whenever you’re seeking improvement, you’re putting yourself on the edge of your abilities, on the hazardous cliff edge of life, and a little built-in thrill accompanies each accomplishment.</p><p>***</p><p>Then follows the first taste of mastery. When he wrote the movie “The Social Network,” Aaron Sorkin had to explain why Mark Zuckerberg was driven to start Facebook. He posited that maybe Zuckerberg was mooning over a lost love. But Zuckerberg himself had a more persuasive explanation: “They just can’t wrap their head around the idea that someone might build something because they like building things.” Maybe coders go on code-writing binges because they just like to code. Whether it’s coding, cooking or gardening, people intrinsically desire to achieve excellence at their craft.</p><p>This desire to build, create and get more competent at something is why Benjamin Franklin taught himself to write by translating magazine articles into poetry and then back into prose. It’s why Bill Bradley taught himself to dribble a basketball by taping cardboard to the bottom of his glasses so he had to rely more on intuition than on sight. It’s why Marcel Proust rewrote portions of “Remembrance of Things Past” from his death bed. Even while in agony, breathing his last breath, he wanted his work to be better, to get it right.</p><p>When you see people ensconced in their craft, you’ll notice that they are often living what I’ve come to think of as a Zone 2 life, after the exercise trend. They are not manic; they are persistent. They’re not burning out with frantic energy, but they are just plowing their furrow, a little bit farther, day after day.</p><p>They live with an offensive spirit. They are drawn by some positive attraction, not driven by a fear of failure. They perceive obstacles as challenges, not threats. On their good days, they’ve assigned themselves the right level of difficulty. Happiness is usually not getting what you want or living with ease; it is living, from one hour to the next, at a level of just manageable difficulty.</p><p>By the time you’ve reached craftsman status you don’t just love the product, you love the process, the tiny disciplines, the long hours, the remorseless work. You may want to be a rock star, but if you don’t love the arduous process of making music and touring, you won’t succeed. The craftsman has internalized knowledge of the field so she can work by intuition, using her repertoire of moves, relying on hunches, not rules. W.H. Auden captured it perfectly:</p><p>You need not see what someone is doingto know if it is his vocation,you have only to watch his eyes:a cook mixing a sauce, a surgeonmaking a primary incision,a clerk completing a bill of lading,wear the same rapt expression,forgetting themselves in a function.How beautiful it is,that eye-on-the-object look.</p><p>When people have reached this stage, they are living a life of leisure. These days we think of “leisure” as the relaxation we do when we’re not at work. But that’s not how people historically defined leisure. To them, leisure is the state of mind we are in when we are doing what we intrinsically want to do. The word “school” comes from the word “schole,” which is Greek for leisure. School is supposed to be any place where people are engaged in the passionate search for knowledge. In his memoir, Murakami doesn’t treat writing as work and running as leisure. They are both interconnected forms of leisure. Van Gogh was in a leisurely frame of mind when he wrote about painting in a letter to his brother, “I am seeking, I am striving, I am in it with all my heart.”</p><p>A person at leisure is the opposite of a person who wants to be an influencer. She is driven by internal propulsion, not for outward display. When that is your mentality, it alters your attitude toward the suffering involved in the process of growth. The drudgery of the work feels like the unfurling of your very nature — a chef endlessly cutting vegetables, a bricklayer endlessly laying brick. One falls into a rhythm that is characteristically one’s own.</p><p>“No matter how mundane some action might appear,” Murakami wrote, “keep at it long enough and it becomes a contemplative even meditative act.” It becomes your natural way of living the world. Michelangelo once reported that things were only right with him when he was holding a chisel in his hand.</p><p>Effort becomes its own reward. Mountain climbers often don’t pick the easiest route up the mountain top; they pick the hardest route they can manage, because they value challenge, growth and the fruits of hard effort itself.</p><p>I was once in a grocery store in central Pennsylvania when I noticed that every jar on every shelf was carefully aligned. Somebody had taken some extra effort for the pleasure of doing it right. I think about this all the time — how our lives are sweetened by everyday excellence: The person smoothly and cheerfully checking you out at the grocery store or checking you in at the hotel reception desk.</p><p>***</p><p>When you’re committed to some big project, your relationship to pain changes. Murakami has clearly learned to take pride and satisfaction in his ability to withstand pain. “Pain is inevitable,” he wrote. “Suffering is optional. Say you’re running and you start to think.Man this hurts, I can’t take it anymore.Thehurtpart is an unavoidable reality, but whether or not you can stand any more is up to the runner himself. This pretty much sums up the most important aspect of marathon running.” As Victor Frankl noted decades ago, people can derive meaning from their ability to withstand necessary suffering.</p><p>A 2012 University of Heidelberg study found that athletes and nonathletes have the same pain threshold, the point at which they feel pain, but that athletes have a higher pain tolerance, the amount of pain they are capable of bearing. And that tolerance comes from having continually overcome themselves in the process of training — experiencing the pain, confronting limitations and pushing through. Murakami reports that he’s not that energized by beating other people in races, just in competing against himself.</p><p>Nietzsche famously wrote that he who has a why to live for can endure any how. If you are gripped by a profound desire, you can endure the setbacks but proceed with determination.</p><p>How do people endure the most severe challenges and overcome the most alluring temptations? It’s generally not through heroic willpower and self-control. (If those faculties were strong enough, diets would work, and New Year’s resolutions would be fulfilled.) We usually can endure pain and difficulty only when we are possessed by a more gripping desire: I love my baby, so I will quit smoking. I love my country, so I will submit to Marine Corps boot camp.</p><p>Self-control is often the art of using a bigger desire to conquer a smaller desire. Once you commit to some vast possibility — loving your child, country or God — some of the lesser distractions and preferences (avoid pain at all costs) seem less compelling.</p><p>Murakami argues that the three most important traits in any writer are talent, focus and endurance. Maybe that’s the right order in inspiration-laden fields like novel writing or composing symphonies, but in most of our vocations, endurance, or stamina, matters most.</p><p>For decades Ray Kroc tried one venture after another — selling paper cups, real estate and milkshake machines, and playing the piano. Finally, in his 50s he heard about a restaurant named McDonald’s, drove halfway across the country to visit it and obsessively oversaw its growth. His determination, he wrote, was embodied in this homily: “Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.” That’s an exaggeration, but not by much.</p><p>The best kind of colleagues at work have the attitude of a fully determined seeker:I’m going to figure this out, no matter what.And that kind of stamina flows only from a desire so steady it almost doesn’t make sense. Murakami is most impressive in his memoir when he is still running marathons in his 50s. His race times are creeping upward though he is training harder; his leg muscles are cramp-prone, the races more agonizing and often disappointing, and yet he keeps insisting that he is very glad that running is in his life and that he hopes to do it until he dies. We’re dazzled when a talented phenom emerges on the scene, but there’s also something tremendously moving about old veterans using their wiles to stay in the game. Murakami is 76 now, and undoubtedly is still running every day.</p><p>***</p><p>I’ve taken us on this journey because I wanted to understand why people choose voluntary pain. But I’ve also taken us on this journey for a deeper reason, because of a growing sense that this kind of arduous life is the best life to live. Like half of America, I’ve been watching “Adolescence” this week on Netflix. That show reveals, in brutal detail, how difficult it is to be a teenager in the age of social media. It cures you of the romantic notion that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger — sometimes trauma just makes life unalterably worse.</p><p>You want to reach out to these kids and lighten the load, reduce stress, make everything easier. And yet I have found that paradoxically life goes smoother when you take on difficulties rather than trying to avoid them. People are more tranquil when they are heading somewhere, when they have brought their lives to a point, going in one direction toward an important goal. Humans were made to go on quests, and amid them more stress often leads to more satisfaction, at least until you get to the highest levels. The psychologist Carol Dweck once wrote: “Effort is one of the things that gives meaning to life. Effort means that you care about something.”</p><p>All this toil is not really about finishing a marathon or a newspaper article or a well-stocked shelf at the grocery store. It’s about slowly molding yourself into the strong person you want to be. It’s to expand yourself through challenge, steel yourself through discipline and grow in understanding, capacity and grace. The greatest achievement is the person you become via the ardor of the journey.</p><p>The self-esteem movement failed because it tried to persuade people that they were great by flattering them and offering words of affirmation. People are not idiots; we need to see ourselves actually accomplishing real things, learning real things, living up to real standards. At the end of his memoir Murakami wrote that on his gravestone he’d like to be identified as a writer and runner, and then he’d like it to say: “At Least He Never Walked.”</p><p>So, sure, on a shallow level we lead our lives on the axis of pleasure and pain. But at the deeper level, we live on the axis between intensity and drift. Evolution or God or both have instilled in us a primal urge to explore, build and improve. But life is at its highest when passion takes us far beyond what evolution requires, when we’re committed to something beyond any utilitarian logic.</p><p>We want to be in love — with callings, projects and people. The opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference, and indifference is an absolutely terrible state to endure. I guess there are some people who have earned the right to want contentment above all, to sit back and enjoy whatever prosperity they’ve achieved. But I rarely meet such people, even people in retirement.</p><p>Several months ago, I had dinner next to a 100-year-old guy. His talk was full of books he was reading, lectures he was attending. I suspect a lot of the desires in his life had faded away — for status, sex — but he still wanted to learn, to grow in understanding.</p><p>We want to see our life as a drama, and the essence of drama is one person’s ferocious desire to confront an enormous obstacle, and the struggle to overcome that obstacle. If you want to understand any character, in a drama or in life, ask, “What pains is he willing to endure?” Some choose the pains of medical school or the priesthood or police work, but through the struggle at least we are acting, improving our skills.</p><p>There’s a scene in “Jurassic Park” in which some visitors are watching a T. Rex being fed lunch in the form of a goat. The Sam Neill character makes an observation that gets the whole movie going. The T. Rex, he says, “doesn’t want to be fed. He wants to hunt.”</p><p>I would hate it if someone took the pain of writing out of my life. I suspect most marathoners would hate it if someone took the pain of those final few miles out of theirs. Our friend Mr. Dopamine is always leaping ahead, always anticipating positive reward, always sensing that there’s something better just over the next ridge. There’s a blessing in that human instability.</p><p>People tend to get melodramatic when they talk about the kind of enchantment I’m describing here, but they are not altogether wrong. The sculptor Henry Moore exaggerated but still captured the essential point: “The secret of life is to have a task, something you devote your entire life to, something you bring everything to, every minute of the day for your whole life. And the most important thing is — it must be something you cannot possibly do!”</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

    <h1>Mike Waltz Left His Venmo Friends List Public</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 26, 2025</span>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>A Venmo account under the name “Michael Waltz,” carrying a profile photo of thenational security adviserand connected to accounts bearing the names of people closely associated with him, wasleft open to the publicuntil Wednesday afternoon. A WIRED analysis shows that the account revealed the names of hundreds of Waltz’s personal and professional associates, including journalists, military officers, lobbyists, and others—information a foreign intelligence service or other actors could exploit for any number of ends, experts say.</p><p>Among the accounts linked to “Michael Waltz” are ones that appear to belong to Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, and Walker Barrett, astafferon the United States National Security Council. Both were fellow participants in anow-infamous Signal group chatcalled “Houthi PC small group.”</p><p>The White House declined to comment after being presented with WIRED’s findings, but the accounts appearing to belong to Waltz and Wiles went fully private following WIRED’s inquiry.</p><p>Earlier this week, The Atlanticreportedthat an account with the name “Michael Waltz” accidentally invited the publication’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to the chat, in which senior administration officials discussed plans for a strike on Yemen. (WaltztoldFox News’ Laura Ingraham he takes “full responsibility” for inviting Goldberg, adding, “We have some of the best technology minds looking at how this happened.”) Over the encrypted messaging app, which Department of Defense guidelinesbarfrom being used for the discussion of any nonpublic defense information, the group debated whether a strike should be carried out at all. Hours after an account with the name of defense secretary Pete Hegseth shared missile targets, strike timing, and other highly sensitive operational details of a coming strike, US forces bombed Houthi targets in Yemen, reportedly killing at least 53 people.</p><p>A WIRED review of public data exposed on Venmo accounts associated with senior administration officials suggests that the Signal group chat was not an isolated mistake, but part of a broader pattern of what national security experts describe as reckless behavior by some of the most powerful people in the US government.</p><p>The Venmo account under Waltz’s name includes a 328-person friend list. Among them are accounts sharing the names of people closely associated with Waltz, such as Barrett, formerly Waltz’s deputy chief of staff when Waltz was a member of the House of Representatives, and Micah Thomas Ketchel, former chief of staff to Waltz and currently a senior adviser to Waltz and President Donald Trump.</p><p>Other accounts carry the names of a wide range of media figures, from on-air personalities like Bret Baier and Brian Kilmeade of Fox News and Brianna Keilar and Kristen Holmes of CNN to a cable news producer, a prominent national security reporter, local news anchors, documentarians, and noted conspiracy theorist Ivan Raiklin, who calls himself the “the secretary of retribution” and once created adeep statetarget list. (Fox News declined to comment; CNN did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p>Many of the accounts appear to belong to local and national politicians and political operatives ranging from US representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas to a former mayor of Deltona, Florida, as well as venture capitalists, defense industry entrepreneurs, and executives like Christian Brose, the president of defense tech giant Anduril. (Crenshaw’s office and Anduril did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>One of the most notable appears to belong to Wiles, one of Trump’s most trusted political advisers. That account’s 182-person friend list includes accounts sharing the names of influential figures like Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, and Hope Hicks, Trump’s former White House communications director.</p><p>While none of the Venmo transactions for the account listed for Waltz, Wiles, or Barrett were publicly visible, it appears that none of them had opted out of sharing their contact list, allowing their friend lists to remain visible to the public. After WIRED reached out to the White House for comment, both Waltz and Wiles appeared to change their Venmo privacy settings to hide their friend lists.</p><p>Venmo spokesperson Erin Mackey said in a statement, “We take our customers’ privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends lists—and we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.” The comment is nearly identical to the one Venmo provided to WIRED in response to a2024 story about now-vice president JD Vance’s Venmo.</p><p>Last July, WIRED reported that Vance had left his Venmo account public, exposing a network of connections to Project 2025 architects, DOJ officials, Yale Law classmates, and far-right media figures. (While it was not reported at the time, WIRED’s analysis of that public Venmo account—and the networks of his listed friends—found that the Michael Waltz Venmo account appeared in Vance’s extended network, comprising friends and friends of friends.) According to The Atlantic, Vance was also an active participant in the Signal chat alongside Waltz, where he questioned whether the planned military operation in Yemen aligned with President Trump’s broader message on Europe.</p><p>When the Michael Waltz account was set up in 2017, the app would display a prompt allowing users to sync their phone contacts, automatically populating their friends list with anyone in their address book already using the platform. Privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation,criticizedthis design, arguing that it exposes users to unnecessary risks by making social connections public by default. It wasn’t until BuzzFeed News revealed in 2021 that then-president Joe Biden was easily found on the app that Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, added the option to hide friend lists. But that setting remains opt-in.According to its privacy policy, unless users proactively change their privacy settings, their network remains visible to anyone.</p><p>Mixed in with the high-profile names connected to the apparent Waltz Venmo account are a number of accounts appearing to belong to ordinary people, such as several doctors, real estate agents, and a tailor. These are the kinds of low-level connections that, experts say, spies look at for basic information—a relationship with a medical specialist could expose that a person is being treated for an illness that hasn’t been made public—as well as patterns, pressure points, or a way in. Experts call them “soft targets”: people who have access but aren’t protected.</p><p>For instance, when the US and Israel reportedly sabotaged Iran’s nuclear program with theStuxnet virus,they used a control engineer’s USB stick, not one belonging to a senior official. Chinese intelligence has used similar tactics, contacting thousands of foreign citizensusing LinkedInorgoing after universitystudents to get closer to US researchers and companies. While WIRED has found no evidence that foreign adversaries have used Venmo to target a US politician’s network, the platform makes these relationships visible—potentially giving adversaries a searchable map of the people around power.</p><p>“The first thing you think of is the counterintelligence issue, right? And the security vulnerabilities. It kind of boggles the mind, in a way,” says Michael Ard, a former intelligence analyst who now runs the masters program in intelligence analysis at Johns Hopkins. “It would be really easy for somebody to spoof a contact, and that is something the security industry has already been issuing notices on.”</p><p>Waltz has spent years inside the Republican national security establishment. A former Green Beret—something reflected in the number of apparent veteran Green Berets, Navy SEALs, and other special operators to whom the Venmo account bearing his name is connected—he served as a defense adviser at the Pentagon under former defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates, and later counseled US vice president Dick Cheney on counterterrorism. In 2020, following the US drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Waltz says he was part of a small group of lawmakers privately briefed at the White House.</p><p>Another participant in that thread was Hegseth. A public Venmo account under his name,identified by The American Prospectin February, revealed a similarly elite network—including names matching executives at defense firms like Palantir and Anduril as well as lobbyists and President George W. Bush–era officials. In the Signal chat, the defense secretary directly responded to Vance’s concerns: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.”</p><p>Both Vance’s and Hegseth’s Venmo accounts have since been deleted.</p><p>Jake Lahut contributed reporting.</p>

    <h1>SignalGate Isn’t About Signal</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 26, 2025</span>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>The eye-popping scandalsurrounding the Trump cabinet’saccidental invitation to The Atlantic’s editor in chief to join a text-message group secretly planning a bombing in Yemen has rolled into its third day, and that controversy now has a name: SignalGate, a reference to the fact that the conversation took place on theend-to-end encrypted free messaging tool Signal.</p><p>As that name becomes a shorthand for the biggest public blunder of the second Trump administration to date, however, security and privacy experts who have promoted Signal as the best encrypted messaging tool available to the public want to be clear about one thing: SignalGate is not about Signal.</p><p>Since The Atlantic’s editor, Jeffrey Goldberg,revealed Mondaythat he was mistakenly included in a Signal group chat earlier this month created to plan US airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the reaction from the Trump cabinet’s critics and even the administration itself has in some cases seemed to cast blame on Signal for the security breach. Some commentators have pointed to reports last month ofSignal-targeted phishing by Russian spies. National security adviser Michael Waltz, who reportedly invited Goldberg to the Signal group chat, has even suggested that Goldberg may havehackedinto it.</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, even President Donald Trump suggested Signal was somehow responsible for the group chat fiasco. “I don't know that Signal works,” Trumptold reportersat the White House. “I think Signal could be defective, to be honest with you.”</p><p>The real lesson is much simpler, says Kenn White, a security and cryptography researcher who has conducted audits on widely used encryption tools in the past as the director of the Open Crypto Audit Project: Don’t invite untrusted contacts into your Signal group chat. And if you’re a government official working with highly sensitive or classified information, use the encrypted communication tools that run on restricted, oftenair-gappeddevices intended for a top-secret setting rather than the unauthorized devices that can run publicly available apps like Signal.</p><p>“Unequivocally, no blame in this falls on Signal,” says White. “Signal is a communication tool designed for confidential conversations. If someone's brought into a conversation who’s not meant to be part of it, that's not a technology problem. That's an operator issue.”</p><p>Cryptographer Matt Green, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, puts it more simply. “Signal is a tool. If you misuse a tool, bad things are going to happen,” says Green. “If you hit yourself in the face with a hammer, it’s not the hammer’s fault. It’s really on you to make sure you know who you’re talking to.”</p><p>The only sense in which SignalGateisa Signal-related scandal, White adds, is that the use of Signal suggests that the cabinet-level officials involved in the Houthi bombing plans, including secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, were conducting the conversation on internet-connected devices—possibly even including personal ones—since Signal wouldn’t typically be allowed on the official, highly restricted machines intended for such conversations. “In past administrations, at least, that would be absolutely forbidden, especially for classified communications,” says White.</p><p>Indeed, using Signal on internet-connected commercial devices doesn’t just leave communications open to anyone who can somehow exploit a hackable vulnerability in Signal, but anyone who can hack the iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac devices that might be running the Signal mobile or desktop apps.</p><p>This is why US agencies in general, and the Department of Defense in particular, conduct business on specially managed federal devices that are specially provisioned to control what software is installed and which features are available. Whether the cabinet members had conducted the discussion on Signal or another consumer platform, the core issue was communicating about incredibly high-stakes, secret military operations using inappropriate devices or software.</p><p>One of the most straightforward reasons that communication apps like Signal and WhatsApp are not suitable for classified government work is that they offer “disappearing message” features—mechanisms to automatically delete messages after a preset amount of time—that are incompatible with federal record retention laws. This issue was on full display in the principals’ chat about the impending strike on Yemen, which was originally set for one-week auto-delete before the Michael Waltz account changed the timer to four-week auto-delete, according toscreenshots of the chatpublished by The Atlantic on Wednesday. Had The Atlantic’s Goldberg not been mistakenly included in the chat, its contents might not have been preserved in accordance with long-standing government requirements.</p><p>In congressional testimony on Wednesday, US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbardsaidthat Signal can come preinstalled on government devices. Multiple sources tell WIRED that this is not the norm, though, and noted specifically that downloading consumer apps like Signal to Defense Department devices is highly restricted and often banned. The fact that Hegseth, the defense secretary, participated in the chat indicates that he either obtained an extremely unusual waiver to install Signal on a department device, bypassed the standard process for seeking such a waiver, or was using a non-DOD device for the chat. According topolitical consultant and podcaster Fred Wellman, DOD “political appointees” demanded that Signal be installed on their government devices last month.</p><p>Core to the Trump administration’s defense of the behavior is the claim that no classified material was discussed in the Signal chat. In particular, Gabbard and others have noted that Hegseth himself is the classification authority for the information. Multiple sources tell WIRED, though, that this authority does not make a consumer application the right forum for such a discussion.</p><p>“The way this was being communicated, the conversation had no formal designation like 'for official use only' or something. But whether it should have been classified or not, whatever it was, it was obviously sensitive operational information that no soldier or officer would be expected to release to the public—but they had added a member of the media into the chat,” says Andy Jabbour, a US Army veteran and founder of the domestic security risk-management firm Gate 15.</p><p>Jabbour adds that military personnel undergo annual information awareness and security training to reinforce operating procedures for handling all levels of nonpublic information. Multiple sources emphasize to WIRED that while the information in the Yemen strike chat appears to meet the standard for classification, even nonclassified material can be extremely sensitive and is typically carefully protected.</p><p>“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it’s also just mind-boggling to me that all of these senior folks who were on this line and nobody bothered to even check, security hygiene 101, who are all the names? Who are they?” US senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said during Tuesday’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.</p><p>According to The Atlantic, 12 Trump administration officials were in the Signal group chat, including vice president JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio, and Trump adviser Susie Wiles. Jabbour adds that even with ​​decisionmaking authorities present and participating in a communication, establishing an information designation or declassifying information happens through an established, proactive process. As he puts it, “If you spill milk on the floor, you can’t just say, ‘That’s actually not spilled milk, because I intended to spill it.’”</p><p>All of which is to say, SignalGate raises plenty of security, privacy, and legal issues. But the security of Signal itself is not one of them. Despite that, in the wake of The Atlantic’s story on Monday, some have sought tenuous connections between the Trump cabinet’s security breach and Signal vulnerabilities. On Tuesday, for example, a Pentagon adviser echoed a report from Google’s security researchers, whoalerted Signalearlier this year to a phishing technique that Russian military intelligence used to target the app’s users in Ukraine. But Signal pushed out an update to make that tactic—which tricks users into adding a hacker as a secondary device on their account—far harder to pull off, and the same tactic also targeted some accounts on the messaging services WhatsApp and Telegram.</p><p>“Phishing attacks against people using popular applications and websites are a fact of life on the internet,” Signal spokesperson Jun Harada tells WIRED. “Once we learned that Signal users were being targeted, and how they were being targeted, we introduced additional safeguards and in-app warnings to help protect people from falling victim to phishing attacks. This work was completed months ago."</p><p>In fact, says White, the cryptography researcher, if the Trump administration is going to put secret communications at risk by discussing war plans on unapproved commercial devices and freely available messaging apps, they could have done much worse than to choose Signal for those conversations, given its reputation and track record among security experts.</p><p>“Signal is the consensus recommendation for highly at-risk communities—human rights activists, attorneys, and confidential sources for journalists,” says White. Just not, as this week has made clear, executive branch officials planning airstrikes.</p><p>Updated at 5:50 pm ET, March 25, 2025: Added remarks about Signal by President Trump.</p>

    <h1>Inside DOGE’s Plan to Invade the Treasury—and Throttle USAID</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 26, 2025</span>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>From the beginning of PresidentDonald Trump’sadministration,Elon Musk’sso-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had a plan to monitor USAID payments and was preparing to useUS Treasury Department systemsto halt them, according to new court documents, emails, and affidavits obtained by WIRED.</p><p>Court documents inAlliance for Retired Americans et al v. Bessent et alandAmerican Federation of Teachers et al v. Bessent et alreveal the extent of DOGE’s penetration into the most sensitive systems at the Treasury, including the Bureau of Fiscal Service (BFS), and what exactly DOGE was hoping to accomplish. The bureau is nested within the US Treasury and handles most federal payments, to the tune of more than $5 trillion a year.</p><p>WIRED first reported that Marko Elez, a former engineer at X, the social media company owned by Musk,had read/write accessto two BFS systems: the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) and Secure Payment System (SPS). But documents now reveal that Elez also had “read” access to Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP), an accounting system where federal funds are stored in pre-authorized accounts. Court documents shared by the government reveal Elez had access as of February 1.</p><p>From court filings, it appears this access was in service of the administration’s plans to target USAID.</p><p>USAID was one of theearliest targetsof DOGE and the Trump administration. Less than two weeks after Trump’s inauguration, the majority of the agency’s staff wereplaced on administrative leave, and funding to many partner organizationswas cut off. The documents appear to show how plans were in place for this sudden strangulation in payments to happen.</p><p>In a January 26 email between Matthew Garber, a top Treasury official, and the Treasury secretary’s chief of staff, Garber outlined the new administration’s plan to utilize BFS access to halt payments to USAID.</p><p>“Fiscal will intercept USAID payments files prior to ingestion into our PAM/SPS systems (this is in place now and can begin immediately),” Garber wrote. “We developed a process to intercept the file, and additional flags to ensure we catch all USAID payment requests through our systems.” (This email chain was included as part of documents shared in theAlliance for Retired Americanslawsuit.)</p><p>“Fiscal will manually pull an unredacted and unmodified copy to share with State officials,” Garber continued, outlining plans from his team. "State officials will review and provide a determination to Fiscal on whether or not to release the file into our normal payment processes.”</p><p>A topTreasury official’s calendarshows that a few days later, Elez arrived in Kansas City, one of the main BFS sites, and had a full docket of meet and greets and several deep dives with the teams responsible for each of the systems. The plan was for Elez to spend the next month at the facility to identify “opportunities to advance payment integrity and fraud reduction goals.” According to a planning sheet, which was also shared with the court, “only (1) individual (i.e. the designated technical team member)”—which was Elez—“requires access to Fiscal Service systems and data at this time.”</p><p>Records show that in the final days of January, a request was placed to grant Elez access to both systems. On January 31, David Lebryk, who had been acting Treasury secretary and at one point was the commissioner of BFS,abruptly announced he would retireafter he had been placed on administrative leave for refusing to provide DOGE with access to these payment systems. For those who knew the Treasury intimately,this set off alarm bells. That same day, according to an attachment provided by the government, at 6:07 pm, a ticket was filed disregarding a previous order just a day before to give Elez just read-only access: “sorry read/write is needed.”</p><p>At the same timeLebryk stepped away, DOGE gained access to the entirety of USAID’s IT systems and network,according to reporting from ProPublica. The next day, as the dismantling of USAID was underway, according to court documents, Elez was granted access to the source codes of ASAP, SPS, and PAM. He was also granted read-only access to the production database for the SPS and PAM.</p><p>People with knowledge of Treasury systems tell WIRED that it would be uncommon, if not “unheard of,” for a BFS employee to have access to all these systems simultaneously.</p><p>“Within Fiscal, the mainframe guys don’t have write access to the databases and vice versa,” says a former BFS employee who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. Normally, they say, employees at BFS are given the minimum amount of access to systems required to do their jobs. “No BFS employee would normally have this kind of access.”</p><p>According to an affidavit from another top Treasury official, though, that plan to isolate USAID payment files outlined by Garber was temporarily paused for the next several days—the State Department had decided it would instead intercept the files. However, on February 4 and February 5, USAID payments flowed to the PAM portal designed by Garber’s team.</p><p>That same affidavit outlined the next steps: BFS was instructed to focus on flagging, quarantining, and sending several payments to State officials that fell under President Donald Trump’s foreign aidexecutive orderthat stated there would be a 90-day pause on this aid as the State Department reviewed each program. This plan, according to an email chain included in one of the lawsuits, was vetted by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who was “comfortable proceeding.” These payments, which originated from the Department of Health and Human Services, included funding for “Refugee and Entrant Assistance,” “Gifts and Donations Office of Refugee Resettlement,” and “Refugee Resettlement Assistance.”</p><p>By then, Musk had doubled down on his contempt for USAID: In aFebruary 2 post on X, Musk wrote, “USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.”</p><p>DOGE operatives, including Luke Farritor, ayoung member, had gained “super administrator” access to USAID’s systems,according to ProPublica. Farritor, who had also been at theDepartment of Health and Human Servicesas well as the General Services Administration (GSA), was reportedly going through USAID’s payment system manually, shutting off agency funding,according to The Washington Post. Elez was in the midst of a similar operation in Kansas City: According to that Treasury official’s affidavit, the engineer began to manually identify and review the foreign aid payment files that had been sequestered in the folder Garber outlined in that late January email.</p><p>Meanwhile, Treasury officials sought to give Elez even further access. A February 3 IT ticket, included in case documents from the Alliance for Retired Americans lawsuit, reveals that requests were made for Elez to access theCentral Accounting Reporting System, “the electronic system of record for the government’s financial data.”</p><p>That same day, a motion filed by the plaintiffs inanother lawsuitalleges Elez copied and downloaded a pair of USAID files from the PAM database to his laptop; around that same time, an affidavit from the Bureau of Fiscal Service’s chief security officer said Elez emailed a spreadsheet with personally identifiable information to two GSA officialsvia unencrypted channels. (Both of these actions are at the core of one of the lawsuits against Bessent and the Treasury Department; the plaintiffs in that suit were recently granted expedited discovery to access records related to Elez’s tenure at BFS.)</p><p>A DOGE team hadalready established a presence at the GSA, whichincluded Farritor, as well as former Tesla employee Thomas Shedd and other DOGE members Ethan Shaotran andEdward Coristine.</p><p>After WIRED reported on February 4 that Elez had unprecedented access to the Treasury’s payments systems, Bessentasserted in a letter to Congressthat Tom Krause, then a special government employee associated with DOGE at the Treasury, only had “read” access. Elez was not mentioned in that letter. In her memo granting a preliminary injunction in theAmerican Federation of Teacherslawsuit, filed on March 24, Judge Deborah Boardman wrote, “according to a spreadsheet attached to a February 3, 2025 email from a Treasury executive point person for the engagement, as of February 1, Elez had access to Treasury systems including PAM, SPS, and ASAP, and it was recommended that his access to other Treasury systems be expanded.”</p><p>On February 5, while Elez had access to Treasury’s most sensitive systems, he received an email from the deputy assistant commissioner for enterprise IT operations noting that, though he had been issued a BFS laptop, he had yet to sign the bureau’s “rules of behavior.” (This email was included among documents shared by the government in one of the lawsuits.) Those rules include, following “laws, regulations, and policies governing the use and entrance to such facilities,” and protecting any “Fiscal Service data, equipment and IT systems from loss, theft, damage, and unauthorized use or disclosure.” Elez, it would appear, had already violated these rules by sharing the data with the GSA officials.</p><p>The next day, Elez resigned after theThe Wall Street Journalsought comment for a report about racist posts on social media accounts that appeared to belong to him. Elez is now one of the many DOGE operatives working at theSocial Security Administration.</p><p>In late February, USAID said it wouldcancel 90 percentof the agency’s contracts. The contract cancellations threw nonprofits around the world intochaosand slowed the response toinfectious diseases. Earlier this month, a federal judge said thedismantling of USAID“likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.”</p><p>The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>This week, Trump signed anexecutive orderstating that all federal payments should be consolidated within the Treasury. The order claims that doing so will help fight fraud, waste, and abuse.</p><p>Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, believes the order means that, “instead of having to send some DOGE guy into an agency to control the payments, it all happens in one place. It moves power away from agencies and centralizes it in the White House.” In his order, Trump claimed that $1.5 trillion passes through other avenues, known as non-Treasury disbursing offices. These are nested within certain agencies that are able to disburse funds without going through the BFS system.</p><p>Moynihan alleges that the strangulation of USAID’s funding could be a “harbinger” of potential changes at other agencies. The administration appears particularly focused, he says, on “the president having absolute power and control over where money goes regardless of laws on impoundment or statutes on agencies.”</p><p>“It’s a consolidation of power in the name of efficiency,” he claims.</p>

        <p>To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories.</p><p>Extropic isnot a normal startup. But then, these are hardly normal times.</p><p>The company is developing a radical new kind of computer chip that harnesses the thermodynamic fluctuations that naturally occur within electronic circuits—and which are normally a headache for engineers—using them to perform highly efficient calculations with probabilities.</p><p>This chip might well find some takers as AI giants search for ever more computer power to buildAI models that perform artificial reasoning, and as we all worry aboutAI’s incredible energy demands.</p><p>Extropic has now shared more details of its probabilistic hardware with WIRED, as well as results that show it is on track to build something that could indeed offer an alternative to conventional silicon in many datacenters. The company aims to deliver a chip that is three to four orders of magnitude more efficient than today’s hardware, a feat that would make a sizable dent in future emissions.</p><p>I wrote about Extropic’s strange backstory for WIRED’sspecial issue on the Frontiers of Computing. My piece explores the remarkable technological, political, and cultural currents that led to the company’s founding. But it’s well worth taking a closer look at Extropic’s technology.</p><p>An image from an oscilloscope that demonstrates how thermodynamic fluctuations can be controlled.</p><p>A technical document provided to me by Extropic includes a signal from an oscilloscope (an instrument that measures electronic voltage over time) showing a probabilistic bit or p-bit in action. A conventional computer bit is fixed as either a one or a zero. A p-bit has a certain probability of being in either state and the oscilloscope image shows a p-bit flipping between 1 and 0. The crucial thing is that Extropic can control the probability that the bit will be in either state at any point in time. And by engineering interactions between several such p-bits it is possible to perform more complex probabilistic computations.</p><p>“This signal on the oscilloscope may seem simple at first glance, but it demonstrates a key building block for our platform, representing the birth of the world’s first scalable, mass-manufacturable, and energy-efficient probabilistic computing platform,” says Guillaume Verdon, CEO of Extropic and the man behind the wildly popular, provocative, and sometimes controversial online personaBased Beff Jezos.</p><p>One of Extropic’s innovations is a way of controlling thermodynamic effects in conventional silicon to perform calculations without extreme cooling. Efforts to compute thermodynamically have traditionally relied on superconducting electronic circuits, but Verdon and his cofounder, Trevor McCourt, are using fluctuations of electric charge in regular silicon instead.</p><p>The image above shows an array of Extropic’s components under a microscope. Credit: Extropic</p><p>Extropic says its hardware is perfect for running Monte Carlo simulations, a class of computation that involves sampling probabilities that is widely used in areas like finance, biology, and AI. These computations are important for building reasoning models likeOpenAI o3andGemini 2.0 Flash Thinkingfrom Google.</p><p>“The reality is that the most computationally-hungry workloads are Monte Carlo simulations,” Verdon says. “We are not just interested in AI, but also applications in simulations of stochastic systems in high-performance computing at large.”</p><p>Extropic’s founders concede that the idea of taking on Nvidia and other chipmakers might seem, on the face of it, absolutely insane. Nvidia’s chips are still the best for training AI, and switching to a completely alien architecture would be costly and time consuming.</p><p>But we are at a unique moment when AI companiesneed so much computer powerfor AI that they are building datacenters next to nuclear power stations, when nation states are set tospend wild amounts on AI, and when thetechnology’s environmental impactis only getting worse. Perhaps, given all this, it is more nuts not to try to reinvent how computers work.</p><p>Do you think Extropic has a chance to challenge Nvidia’s chip dominance? Is it time to rethink computing entirely? Share your thoughts by emailinghello@wired.comor in the comments section below.</p>

    <h1>Review: Avocado Green Mattress</h1>

        <p>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.</p><p>9/10</p><p>The Avocado GreenMattress was my introduction toorganic mattresses, and after testing nearly a dozen others, it's still my personal favorite.</p><p>Avocado's organic, nontoxic mattresses are made in the USA from GOLS-certified organic latex, GOTS-certified organic wool, and GOTS-certified organic cotton. While the sustainable, organic materials and eco-friendly construction were definitely part of the initial appeal, what really stands out about Avocado in all my testing is the comfort.</p><p>Avocado makes a few different mattresses: the original Avocado Green Mattress, which is what I've tested, along with a Luxury version (which adds Hemp and is overall a plusher, softer mattress) and a lower-priced Eco version. Avocado also offers a vegan mattress that is the same as the original, but does not use wool.</p><p>One of the standout features of the Avocado Green Mattress is the company's use of high-quality organic and sustainable materials (see Avocado’svarious eco certifications here). The mattress uses 100 percent GOLS (Global Organic Latex Standard) certified latex, which is sourced from organic rubber trees. The processing of rubber into latex is not the happy organic process some would like to claim, but at least in working with GOLS, Avocado is meeting the permissible limits for harmful substances and has to test emissions, as well as meet polymer and filler standards. It is, in short, as safe and nontoxic as latex can be.</p><p>The latex is really the core of what provides the comfort in this mattress, helping it to shape to the contours of your body but without the suffocating feeling of sinking into a toxic quicksand, which is what I think of every time I sleep on memory foam. Organic, natural latex has the support and softness of foam, but without the chemicals. Avocado uses organic Dunlop latex in the Firm mattress (which is more than 95 percent certified organic material), while the Plush model uses the softer Talalay latex.</p><p>Organic latex is also hypoallergenic, making it a great option for anyone with allergies triggered by indoor pollutants like mold and mildew, or dust mites, all of which organic latex is less prone to than chemical foams.</p><p>Another way Avocado avoids the chemicals is by using organic wool, which acts as a natural flame retardant, meaning the mattress doesn't need harmful chemicals or synthetic fire barriers.Wool is an amazing fiber, and here it also helps your body naturally regulate its temperature, keeping you warm in winter and cool in summer. More on that in a bit.</p><p>Avocado Green Natural Organic Mattress</p><p>Rating: 9/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>The structure of Avocado's mattress comes from the pocketed coils, which are steel coils wrapped in a sleeve (the pocket) made of fabric. With pocketed coils, each coil moves independently, which increases motion isolation. That means you get the support of an innerspring mattress while minimizing what mattress makers refer to as “motion transfer,” meaning you don't feel like you're on a trampoline every time your partner rolls over. My 8-year-old has climbed onto our Avocado in the middle of the night without waking me, which, given that his normal nighttime mode of travel closely resembles a herd of stampeding elephants, is something of a miracle. That said, if you're coming from a memory foam mattress, there is more motion transfer than that, but much less than many other mattresses I've tested. In a queen-size mattress I find the motion transfer of the firm variant to be almost nonexistent.</p><p>The final bit of material is GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certified organic cotton, which is used for the cover and gives the mattress a soft, breathable layer for comfort (don't worry wool haters, you never actually touch the wool in this mattress, it's below the surface under the cotton cover).</p><p>There are three firmness options available in the Avocado Green Mattress: Firm, Medium, and Plush. If you're a stomach or back sleeper you'll likely enjoy the firmness level of either the Firm or Medium, while side sleepers might favor the Plush. To give side sleepers some relief at pressure points, like the shoulders and hips, the Plush pillow-top version includes an additional layer of latex for extra cushioning, offering that softer feel, but retaining the nice support of the Firm (if you have lower back pain or other back issues, have a look at our guide tothe best mattresses for easing back pain).</p><p>Avocado Green Natural Organic Mattress</p><p>Rating: 9/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>That said, I am a combination sleeper, which is a nice way of saying I sleep in a chaotic variety of ways including on my side, and I still prefer the Firm. The latex in the Firm offers enough comfort for me but retains that slightly bouncy feel, which helps those of us who move a lot during sleep. Another thing I like about the Firm is the additional edge support, which helps prevent sagging on the sides, meaning you can actually sleep across the entire mattress. I should also note that if you opt for the Firm and it proves too firm, you could add one of the company’sorganic toppers.</p><p>Possibly I like wool too much. Unlikely, because wool is amazing, but either way I'd be remiss not to point out that the Avocado mattress is somewhat magical in its temperature regulation capabilities, at least for me. I am a hot sleeper. A “furnace” according to my wife (camping in the winter, I am totally comfortable in a 10-degree sleeping bag, even when temps drop well below 0). The Avocado mattress is one of the few mattresses I've ever used where I hardly ever wake up sweating. Something about the combination of the latex layer, which allows for more airflow than foam, with the organic wool layer, which wicks away moisture and helps regulate your body temperature throughout the night, makes the Avocado excellent for anyone who sleeps hot.</p><p>Mattresses are a significant investment and will ideally last 15 years or more. I have slept on the Avocado Green Mattress for well over a year in my original testing, and recently started testing again, which gives me a total of about 16 months of sleeping on this mattress. In that time there has been no sagging or wear at all, so far as I have been able to feel or observe. That's not to say that there won't be given another 14 years of use, but at least in my testing, it's off to a strong start.</p><p>Avocado offers a25-year warrantythat covers any defects or issues, including visible indentation “equal or greater than one and a half inches.”</p><p>Avocado Green Natural Organic Mattress</p><p>Rating: 9/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>The mattress arrives compressed and should be opened and released within 30 days. Since it’s made entirely of natural materials, there’s no new-mattress off-gassing to worry about. Just remove your old mattress and release the Avocado from its plastic wrapping. Avocado also suggests rotating your mattress head-to-toe once a month for the first six months, then every other month for the life of the mattress to ensure even wear.</p><p>Avocado offers free shipping within the United States, and the mattress comes with a 365-night sleep trial, which is one of the most generous trial periods in the industry. This trial allows you to test out the mattress in the comfort of your home and return it for a full refund if it’s not right for you.</p><p>Overall, the Avocado Green Mattress Firm is my favorite mattress and the one I return to when I'm not testing other organic mattresses. It offers excellent support, softness where you want it (and plusher variants for those who want them), and enough firmness that you aren't bouncing when your partner tosses and turns. The icing on the cake is the eco-conscious organic latex, wool, and cotton, which all help make your sleep environment healthy and free of harmful chemicals and toxins.</p><p>The price ranges from $1,400 for a twin to $2,700 for a California king, although the mattresses are often discounted. There are additional costs for Medium Pillow-Top and Plush Box-Top that vary based on size.</p><p>Avocado Green Natural Organic Mattress</p><p>Rating: 9/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p>

They love their kids but also have plenty of their own hobbies (cooking! running! gaming!), and they deserve gifts that honor them as people, not just as parents. Gifts for Mom shouldn't be about giving her a vacuum or anything related to the stereotypical cleaning tasks of parenthood—a perfect gift for your mom will show that you know how she likes to spend the rest of her hours when she isn’t parenting. This guide has fun gift ideas for all kinds of moms (and mothers-in-law!), whether it’s forMother’s Day, Christmas, a birthday, or just because.</p><p>Looking for more true mom gear to help your favorite mama out? We have guides on everything frombreast pumpsandstrollerstothe best baby gearfor that first year. Don't forget to check out our guides forcoffee lovers,working from home, andbeing perpetually coldif you’re looking for something a little more specific.</p><p>Updated March 2025: We've added the Mission Outdoor Cassi Tote, The Stakt Mat, and the Camp Snap camera to this guide.</p><p>Power up with unlimited access toWIRED.Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just$2.50$1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content.Subscribe Today.</p><p>Amazon hasfour new Kindles, refreshing the entire line in a bigger way than it ever has before. There are three updates to its existing lines with a new Kindle, Kindle Paperwhite, and Kindle Scribe, plus the first-ever color Kindle, the Kindle Colorsoft (7/10, WIRED Recommends). And you know what Mom wants? A new Kindle, probably. My favorite is the Kindle Scribe, since I love the digital notebook aspect, but the new basic Kindle comes in a cute matcha color that's great for gifting.</p><p>If she doesn’t need an all-new Kindle, I love using theLamicall Tablet Holder ($30)to hold up my Kindle for me as I read. I have wrists cysts (nicknamed Mommy's Wrist cysts!) that usually make it painful to hold even a lightweight Kindle up for too long, butthis handy holder takes that pain away. It latches onto nearby tables or furniture, or you can gift thefloor stand ($70)version.</p><p>Being a mom requires a lot of energy, which makesa good night's sleep pretty essential. I test tons of sleep gear, from mattresses and sheets to sound machines, but my biggest necessity for a good night's sleep—and waking up without feeling like the walking dead—is a sunrise alarm clock. A sunrise clock will gently rouse you from sleep by slowly brightening over the course of a set time (think 20 or 30 minutes) and playing gentle music once it's brightened. The best ones also have a bedtime routine, letting be lulled to sleep by a dimming light and sounds of your choice. There are a lot ofgreat sunrise alarms out there, but the Lumie Bodyclock Shine 300 ismy giftable go-towith its sleek shape, fabric base, bright light you can use as a bedside lamp, and wind-down and wake-up routines. It's not too expensive, either, compared to others that have the same features for more. The only downside is that it only tells military time.</p><p>Best for sound:TheHatch Restore 2 ($170)is similar to both Lumie models, but has more sounds and an app to control your routines. I love the Hatch Restore for falling asleep, but it's not quite bright enough to make me wake up like the Lumie sunrise alarms are.</p><p>The weather is warming up, and we're already heading to the beach where I live. The best beach bag I've tried is the Mission Outdoor Cassi tote, which was inspired by the Bogg Bag but is easier to store with a taller, slimmer design instead of the boxy style. The result is a stylish waterproof bag that's easy to clean, easy on the eyes, and fits all kinds of beach gear. I often have three towels, my 2-year-old's and my water bottles, a couple of dry bags of outfit changes and swim diapers, plus some snacks and my hip pack. There's a single built-in pocket to keep a smartphone safe and dry from the ground, and a key hook.</p><p>If your mom is worried about anything from acne to aging, there's a cool gadget to help with that. LED masks are all the rage these days, and our favorite ones pack both a red light mode to fight aging and a blue light mode to fight acne. The Dr. Dennis Gross DRx SpectraLite Faceware Pro is a great choice for moms. Not only does it combine both treatments into one, letting you treat both concerns at the same time with this combination mode—most will make you do one and then the other—but also the SpectraLite's treatments are only three minutes, whereas most others will require 10 minutes. As a mom, any chance you can take better care of yourselfanddo things quickly is the best combo you could hope for. It's one of themore comfortable masks we've tested, too.</p><p>Or, perhaps, the moms who wish to be stretchy, especially if they're battling achy knees and joints while in yoga class. The Stakt Mat is a stacking mat (thus the name!) that folds up easily to create more support where you need it, and it’s easy to clean the mat up after class. I love double folding for extra knee support in flexibility class, but the mat feels like an extra firm yoga block, keeping the feeling of the hard floor away from my sensitive knees even if I don't fold the mat over. It's an impressive twist on a yoga mat, and one I'm recommending to all my mom friends.</p><p>Show Mom how much you appreciate the way her organized brain works (after all, it's what makes so many things happen, like groceries and summer camp sign-ups) with these cute, customized notepads from Plum Paper. Plum Paper makes our favorite paper planner, but you can get a pint-sized version of the same customization with these fun little daily to-do lists. TheDaisy Notepad ($11)gives you a couple different boxes you can label and a top-three section, while theMaking Moves ($11)gives you two long sections for those never-ending to-do lists. There's alsoteacher-themed optionsif Mom's a teacher, and moresimple single-list onesyou can add her name to.</p><p>If a mom in your life always wishes she had more physical photographs but doesn't have the time to print or organize them, Printique's beautiful photo albums are a perfect solution. I finally printed my wedding photos from three years ago (oops!) with a Printique book, and it has made me so happy to finally have these photos somewhere I can pull off the shelf and enjoy. Printique's program is easy to use. It connects to Google Photos to pull pictures you might want to add and has tons of layouts that you can just plug pictures into. I did the new silk album, which gives it a silky cover, and there's other options like velvet and leather. It's a great gift to give, and I'm hoping to be gifted many more of these with phases of my family together.</p><p>Does your mom have a teacup collection like my mother and I do? Or does she love clear, chic glassware? Art of Tea's glass teacups are my new go-to formy daily cup of tea. They're beautiful to look at and comfortable to hold, and they hold just the right amount of tea for a well-brewed cup. (And they’re dishwasher safe!) If you think she already has too many teacups,Art of Tea’s Iced Tea Bundle Kit ($37)lets her brew delicious iced tea in a container worth putting on the tea table.</p><p>If your mom or mom friend laments that she'd like to be on her phone less but doesn't want to miss out on any photo moments, then the adorable Camp Snap is the perfect solution. This fun digital camera takes digital photos that feel straight out of the 2000s, allowing her to go phone-free without missing a chance to take a photo. The Camp Snap comes in a ton of cute colors and can hold up to 2,000 photos on the preinstalled memory card. It comes with an included USB-C cable to download the photos onto your computer, but it has no screen on the device itself, so she gets to take her photos without getting distracted double-checking the results. Plus, some colors can ship immediately, making it a great last-minute gift.</p><p>Some of us are always cold. (We'vegot a guide for that!) Some of us are often cold but don't want to betoowarm either and struggle to stay warm enough without getting sweaty. Well, if you're like that, so am I, and I have our perfect accessory: the Casper Snoozewear Blanket. It looks like a down comforter, but it's shaped like a very oversized house coat (with pockets!) that you can wrap around you and wear as you wander around the house, lay on the couch, or huddle in the office pestering your husband for another cup of tea. I love it since it leaves my legs to stay cool but keeps me just warm enough with my upper body nice and wrapped up. The leg-free design makes it easy for me to move around without needing to shed my cozy layer. Plus, I get to feel like a giant marshmallow.</p><p>If she loves a good blowout, I can't recommend the Drybar Double Shot enough. Every time I use this blow-dry brush to dry my hair, I get the most compliments—my friends can tell when I use the Drybar compared to other blow-dry brushes that leave me a little frizzier. It's powerful and lightweight and has three heat levels (cool, low, and high) that you control on the base of the brush.</p><p>If she loves a blowout some days but wants to diffuse her curls other days, I recommend theBeachwaver Blow Dry Set ($190), which comes with multiple attachments, including a blow-dry brush and a diffuser. It's incredibly lightweight and comes in a cute pink shade.</p><p>Is her wallet missing again? Or her keys? Get Mom a ChipoloBluetooth tracker. Chipolo makes three different series, in two different form factors, that work with different operating systems. TheOne ($25)works with Chipolo's app, thePoint ($28)works with Google Find My, and the Spot works with Apple Find My. I get instant alerts when my phone notices I left it behind somewhere that isn't my house. It can even tell me when I've left my purse in the parking lot when I'm at the dance studio only a few doors away. The Spot is a little more versatile; the small, round tracker has a hole so you can clip it to your keys or even a backpack. Now she can find everything—as long as she can find her phone, of course.</p><p>I love Birthdate Co.’s candles so much that I got one for each of my friends. Each one has a custom scent designed for that day of the year and includes various birth-date knowledge on the label, including astrology details,which makes for a great personalized gift. You can gift her her own birthday or a child’s birthday (or both!) so she can commemorate two of the most important days of her life and geek out on the fun information the candle has for that day of the year.</p><p>If Mom has takes too many photos she could ever enjoy, get her an Aura frame she can watch them on whenever she likes. The Aura app makes it easy to quickly upload photos from your camera roll or Google Photos, and it'll let her know if she's already uploaded that photo, too.  Aura makes severaldigital photo frames, but I liked using the Walden because the 15-inch screen makes it easy to enjoy the photos from across a large room. It's also thinner than other digital photo frames, and comes with the option to wall mount it or place it on a tabletop.</p><p>After testingdozens of strollers, I'm shocked to tell you that many of them do not come with cup holders. Or the ones that do can't handle mybig, dumb cup. If you know a mom in her stroller era—that is, her kid is anywhere from newborn to around 5 years old, so they fit into a stroller—get her this fantastic universal stroller organizer. I've used it on everything fromtravel strollersto theever-popular Uppababy Vista V2, and it really is universal to strap on with the Velcro straps and start strolling. It's big enough to fit two dumb cups, or in my case usually one big dumb cup for mom and one kiddo water bottle. The purse-like straps make it easy to carry around off the stroller, so the mom you gift it to (or yourself, I don't judge) can bring it inside to load it up, and carry it with it around her wrist so she's semi hands-free getting out the door.</p><p>While I like that smart displays can show me online recipes, some of my favorite recipes are handed down by word of mouth or family members, or my husband and I have edited them for our own perfect version. If your mom has her own special recipes, get her a beautiful recipe book from Papier where she can write them all down. These recipe books are well-made and lovely to look at, and something she can treasure as a keepsake and use for years to come. I have one for my own recipes that I'm slowly filling in.</p><p>Or, if your mom has various sheets of paper that hold her recipes (cut-out magazine pages! Recipes my dead grandmother wrote down! Weird notecards!) and isn't likely to rewrite her recipes, get her an organizer to keep them all in. I gotthis one ($22)for my parents and am so happy to see all their battered pieces of paper stored safely to use.</p><p>I love bubble baths to relax, but unlike my kid, I need more than just a field of bubbles or a colorful bath bomb to keep me entertained. The Aquala's Bathtub Caddy is my favorite bath tray I've ever tried. I can balance a Kindle or book, glass of wine, and a candle on it. It's easy to adjust to any bath size with the adjustable arms, and the wire arms make it both compact to store and easy to move in or out of the bath without worry of smacking myself in the face with a giant all-wood tray. It’s sleek enough to leave out as some casual home decor too. Just make sure Mom's tub has at least a half-inch lip on both sides where the tray can balance.</p><p>When I think about a portable shower, I immediately lose myself in fantasy by thinking about how amazing it would be to go to the beach and rinse off my family without sand migrating all over the car and everyone bitching about how itchy they are for the entire drive home. Several WIRED surfers already own Nemo’s version, which packs down to fit in the trunk, is easy to refill, stands on its own feet, and has an 11-liter capacity, which is enough for a five- to seven-minute hands-free shower. It’s also black, so you can fill it and let it sit in the sun to warm up if you’re feeling very bougie, or you can rinse off dogs, paddleboards, or whatever else has gotten completely disgusting. (Everything. The answer iseverything.) It also has a lifetime warranty.—Adrienne So</p><p>Calpak's clear cosmetics cases have gone viral for a reason. The cases come in three sizes—small ($75),medium ($85), andlarge ($95)—and multiple color options for the top and edges around the clear plastic body of the cases. The small is great for a purse or a gym bag, if you needed to throw a little makeup and deodorant stick somewhere secure, or some travel-size bottles. The medium is big enough to use for everyday makeup and hair items as well as any trips your mom or mom friend might go on—I have five large hair clips, lots of makeup, and a full-size hair brush inside my medium case. The large is the size I'd buy for my own mother, because no case is ever big enough for her, whether she's traveling or just organizing all her makeup in her bathroom drawers. If you want to look at more picks, check out our guide to theBest Toiletry Bags.</p><p>If your mom loves to roll dice and watchCritical Role, do I have the gift for her. One of the most precious and unique gifts I've gotten in recent years was these gorgeous gaming journals from Crow & Crown. They're designed to replace your character sheet in Dungeons & Dragons, taking a frankly hideous piece of paper and turning it into a much easier-to-use (and much prettier-to-look-at!) little journal for any role-player mom to track her character's abilities and supplies. TheBag of Holding Tote ($20)is also just begging to be gifted.</p><p>If Mom's looking to get a little more relaxed these days with the help of some THC, my go-to has become Nowadays THC spirit. Not only does it taste great, with a light, sweet profile that sits somewhere in between a floral gin and a fruity sake, but it's infused with either 2, 5, or 10 milligrams of THC (per 1.5 ounces), depending on which bottle you buy. I chose the 2-mg Micro Dose option, and it's been fun to bring to parties to mix into a drink and be able to enjoy a couple of cocktails before the buzz kicks in. It's great on its own or mixed with seltzer like a gin and tonic. I can't recommend it enough if you're looking for something to help you relax.</p><p>10% Off Wayfair Promo Code with sign-up</p><p>20% off Dyson Promo Code</p><p>$50 Off In-Person Tax Prep When You Switch From Your Tax Current Provider</p><p>Up to $500 off cameras at Canon</p><p>Save extra 10% Off TurboTax</p><p>Exclusive: Up To 50% Off 6 Boxes With Factor Promo Code</p>

    <h1>A New Social Media App Punishes Users for Rage-Baiting</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 26, 2025</span>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>If there isone certainty of social media in 2025, it’s this: Rage clicks rule. Hyperbole, hate, cheap shock—it’s all par for the course—and often rewarded with virality.</p><p>But Sez Us, an app just launched by veteran Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, believes it’s possible to change that by punishing users who shitpost for the sake of provocation.</p><p>The timing may be just right. America is entering anage of oligarchywith a rising wave of right-wing extremism taking hold of global politics. Platforms like Truth Social and X now operate as effective propaganda machines, recasting culture-war issues over immigration,DEI, andtrans rightsas boogeymen in President Trump’s new vision of America, which is really just a very old version of America. As the next era of social media comes into view, emerging platforms also have an opportunity to rise to the moment. Can Sez Us, which is positioning itself as the antithesis to X, facilitate a better way forward?</p><p>“If you bring back responsibility, ownership, and reputation, then suddenly all the incentives that we have in the real world are back,” says Yevgeny Simkin, Sez Us’ cofounder and chief product officer.</p><p>Even as online discourse has devolved intorabid spectacle, platforms like Bluesky have shown there is an appetite for a more civil kind of conversation. Rather than boosting any post that’s getting rage clicks, Sez Us uses what its creators call a “reputation engine,” a feature that allows you to rate another user’s posts on the platform across five key areas: approval, influence, insightfulness, relevance, and politeness.</p><p>On the app, ratings determine a user’s reputation score and overall visibility. The higher the score, the more reach you have in the community. Users control who replies to them based on a person’s score, with low-scoring users penalized by having less influence. All posts are visible but you can block users from replying to you, for example, if they don’t have high-approval ratings. Ultimately, ratings are designed to deprioritize engagement based around viral moments.</p><p>“It’s not about the moderators coming in and saying ‘you’re bad,’” Simkin says. “It’s about the community saying ‘we don’t like what you’re saying.’ Then I know that I have to temper how I say things. I have to be more polite. I have to be less bombastic.”</p><p>In the race to perfect social media, there has never been a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to moderation—for those whostill bother with it. Scale can make this task even more difficult as a platform’s user base grows. For Simkin and his team, the idea was to build a platform that would “bring to the fore all the ways in which social media should be running rather than the way it has been,” he says. “The camel’s back was broken by the straw ofElon [Musk] buying Twitter,” and suddenly a whole new world seemed possible.</p><p>The fracturing of Twitter, sincerebranded as X, kicked off an arms race among techies who had all sorts of ideas about the next phase of social media, and how to define it. It was during this period, in 2022, that the concept for Sez Us was born, grounded in the lofty goal of bringing back civil discourse.</p><p>Returning constructive debate to online discourse is important to Simkin. “I have a particular view on freedom of expression and freedom of freedom because I’m familiar with what it means not to have either,” he says. In 2022, as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, Simkin, who was raised in Soviet Russia before immigrating to Canada, builtSamizdat Online, an anti-censorship platform that allows citizens in totalitarian societies to read news by banned outlets without fear of being tracked and persecuted.</p><p>Similar toBluesky, another new-ish app that has emerged as an alternative to Elon Musk’s X, Sez Us does not own any of your data. It was built using a decentralized social networking protocol, which allows users to move their assets and content across platforms. Bots are kept off the app through mobile verification. Low scores likewise prevent bots and individuals with bad intentions from gaining traction.</p><p>“Numbers aren’t the holy grail of this thing,” says Akshay Gupta, the chief operations officer. “Just because you have a massive score doesn't mean you're winning on the platform. It just allows people to know what type of reputation you have.” Even if that is true, reputation scores do ultimately matter in the end. The lower the number, the less reach a user is allowed.</p><p>When I mention to Simkin and Gupta that the idea behind its moderation-based scoring reminds me ofan episode ofBlack Mirror, they push back. “We’re not defining what’s civil. It's theOverton windowof the community. Whoever is there gets to participate and then those metrics will move,” Simkin says.</p><p>Many startup founders have tried, and failed, to design their own version of a digital Elysium. The main obstacle working against emerging social platforms that have launched in the past three years is TikTok. They don’t have its cool, reach, or strange wonder. But that is also their advantage. What the next age of social connection calls for—one of the many things, at least—is not more super platforms but instead purpose-driven communities. It calls for digital rallying grounds of all sorts, ones like Reddit but also likeBlackSky, a Bluesky community for Black users, which already mirrors a version of what Sez Us wants to accomplish.</p><p>“No new endeavor is going to be dead on out the gate,” Gupta adds. “We’ve got an intention. We have a North Star. And we’re starting to see the behavioral elements of it work. Disagreements are great. We’re not stopping anyone from coming on the platform.” All backgrounds, religious affiliations, and political perspectives are welcome, they say.</p><p>It’s hard to know if any of this will work. Right now, Sez Us only has 10,000 active users. And Simkin has measured expectations for what they can accomplish. “I’m not looking to improve humanity,” he says. “That’s somebody else’s job.”</p><p>By incentivizing healthy discussion, he says, the plan is “to move technological discourse to a level where people can engage as themselves. The key is to help everybody recognize that we're actually not enemies.” Whether a critical mass of people wants that remains to be seen.</p>

    <h1>The Best Smart Speakers With Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri</h1>

        <p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>There are manysmart speakers on the market, and picking the best keeps getting tougher. First, you need to decide which voice assistant you prefer. There are three worth using—Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple’s Siri—and each has its pros and cons. If you’re new, we still prefer Google- and Amazon-powered models, as they are the most widely user-friendly.</p><p>Second, you need to figure out which speaker has the features you want. Is music quality your top concern? Do you want a touchscreen, or is voice assistance alone enough? Does your speaker need to connect to other smart home gadgets? That’s where finding the best option gets trickier. Don’t fear, you’ll find what you’re looking for here!

With the newest Era 100 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), Sonos expands the best smart speaker to stereo and ups the bass, with new tweeters and a 25 percent larger woofer that do an even better job of filling your room with sound.</p><p>Built-in room tuning is especially awesome in this generation, with the ability to bounce a quick frequency scan around your room to help it automatically EQ itself for its exact placement. It's not a gimmick: Bass sounds tighter, and highs shimmer even more. The new smart speaker also comes with a few physical improvements, including a large volume slider on top, and it has a switch that lets you easily mute the mics if you don't want any voice assistant action. As before, it supports Alexa and Apple AirPlay 2 for easy integration with any smart home ecosystem.</p><p>If you’re used to asking Google Assistant to control your Sonos speakers, you're out of luck with the two new Era models (this one and the 300, mentioned below)—they don't support it.</p><p>Multiroom audio support, as well as support for nearly every audio streaming app around, are what really set Sonos apart from other major smart speakers. It's just so easy to integrate them into your space. With the new Bluetooth connectivity offered by the Era 100, you can evenwirelessly connect a turntable. (I know, blasphemy!) If you want to keep things wired, the USB-C port on the back of the Era 100 lets you connect other devices with a dongle.</p><p>As with its predecessor, you're able to use a couple of Era 100s as surround speakers withSonos soundbarsin your home theater, and you can pair two Era 100s for use as stereo speakers. It's worth noting that Sonos was ina bit of hot water in 2020over the fact that its older speakers weren't going to get software updates. There is now afix to support legacy hardware, but unfortunately, this is a reality for computer-powered speakers. Unlike their analog predecessors, you can't expect them to last forever. Sonos smart speakers, however, have a track record of lasting longer than anything else we've tested, and that will likely continue in the Era era.</p><p>Connects to Alexa, Sonos App, and AirPlay 2. Has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p><p>Photograph: Amazon</p><p>Amazon's Echo speaker (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a cute ball of sound that brings the same bold bass and wide soundstage as the previous model, but with more room-filling sound than ever before. You can put it anywhere—kitchens, bathrooms, even smaller living rooms—and it easily fills the space with 360-degree sound.</p><p>Compared to Google'sNest Audio speaker, this is a great one for off-axis listening (i.e., when you're not sitting directly in front of the speaker). Alexa also makes getting news and weather updates convenient, and it's dead simple to set kitchen timers and alarm clocks. We also like that you can turn off the microphones with a physical button, for when voice-assistant-wary friends and relatives are over. If you're after a simple, audio-focused Alexa speaker that doesn't get in the way and won't break the bank, this is the best you'll find.</p><p>While the main Echo won't get the new Alexa+ assistant option (more on that below) as early as the Echo smart displays, it will lose the privacy feature to process requests locally. That means recordings of every command spoken to Alexa in any Echo speaker, even if it isn't using Alexa+,will automatically be sent to Amazon and processed in the cloud. This change begins March 28, 2025.</p><p>Connects to Alexa.</p><p>Photograph: Google</p><p>The Nest Audio (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is Google's direct Echo competitor, and it fares extremely well. It's got a compact, pillow-like shape and great sound that will easily fill small and medium-size rooms. We really like using two Nests as a stereo pair because they combine to offer some of the best audio quality you can achieve in a smart speaker for $200.</p><p>As with all Google Assistant–powered devices, you can ask the Nest Audio to set timers, play music, or tell you the weather, and you can ask it anything you'd search on Google. The Google Home app makes it easy to pair up the speakers with any other Google-friendly smart device you have too.</p><p>Connects to Google Assistant.</p><p>Photograph: Simon Hill</p><p>Sonos’ second-generation Beam is thebest smart soundbaryou can buy right now. It might look similar to the first-generation model, but it's got major sound upgrades. The Beam also has plenty of inputs, has immersive Dolby Atmos, and pairs with both Alexa and Google Assistant. It's easy to use withother Sonos speakersas a multiroom audio system, too.</p><p>Connects to Alexa or Google Assistant, Sonos App, and AirPlay 2. Has Wi-Fi, HDMI eARC, Ethernet, IR receiver for TV remote.</p><p>Photograph: Nena Farrell</p><p>Smart displays are great in a few different parts of the home, like the kitchen or an entryway, but might go mostly unused. The Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) fixes that by marrying a tablet and a smart display into one handy device. The 11-inch tablet sits on the included Docking Station to turn it into a smart display, appearing almost identical to the Google Nest Hub Max, and you simply pop it off the display to turn it back into a tablet. (There may be a slight learning curve to properly disengaging it from the magnet base.)</p><p>Popping it onto the dock activates the tablet's Hub Mode, and you can customize the display to either show your Google Photos or select one of the fun clock designs. You can easily control smart home devices by tapping the Google Home icon on the lock screen, which will pull up an overlay of your favorite smart home devices to let you control them and check camera feeds on doorbells and Wi-Fi cameras. This feature is only available while docked, so your camera feeds are safe from strangers if you take the tablet out and about with you.</p><p>The Pixel Tablet is now our currentfavorite smart displayfor a number of other reasons. The dock's built-in speakers have robust sound with surprisingly decent bass, so you can jam while you're in the kitchen or the living room. There's also multiuser support that lets you add up to eight accounts, each of which can have custom apps, layouts, and wallpapers all protected by fingerprint, so the whole family can use this device without infringing on one another.</p><p>If you don't want to splurge on getting both a tablet and a smart display, the Nest Hub Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a great option with similar features, a large screen, and pretty impressive speakers considering the slim profile.</p><p>Connects to Google Assistant.</p><p>Photograph: Nena Farrell</p><p>The Echo Show 8 (3rd Gen) keeps everything we liked about the previous model, but adds the features we like on Amazon's pricier Echo Show displays. For the new kicks, the third-gen Show 8 gains a smart home hub that works with Zigbee, Matter, and Thread devices, and it has spatial audio capabilities (though not all music services can take advantage of this feature). It also gains widgets, which allow you to put little Post-It-sized shortcuts on your screen to things like your favorite smart home devices, calendar, or even a little digital sticky note. On the Echo Show 8 these don't always show up, as they're part of the display's content rotation, but they're fun and handy when they do.</p><p>Besides that, the Show 8 still has great sound and a perfect-size screen for seeing the weather and reading recipes without hogging too much counter or tablespace. It's easy to control your music and smart home devices, watch videos, and get content like sports scores and weather alerts right on the screen. The 13-MP camera lets you take video calls and doubles as a security camera, or as a way to video call your family within the house. The only downside is that Amazon now runs ads on its Echo Show devices, butthere's a hack to somewhat fix it.</p><p>The Echo Show 8 is one of the devices slated to getfirst access to Alexa+, Amazon's new voice assistant, which comes out later this spring. Before that release, though, the impending arrival will cause the privacy feature that keeps your voice recordings stored locally to go away. As of March 28, 2025, all voice commands willautomatically be sent to Amazon and processed in the cloud.</p><p>Connects to Alexa.</p><p>★ A cheaper, similar Echo Show:Thesecond-gen Echo Show 8 ($130)is a little cheaper and is still a great choice if you don't have your heart set on new features like the smart home hub or spatial audio.</p><p>Photograph: Google</p><p>If you aren’t in it for the music, the Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) and Google'sNest Mini(7/10, WIRED Recommends) will give you most of the perks of owning a smart speaker, and you can use them to make existing speakers smarter on the cheap. The sound is very similar between models, and they have nearly identical footprints, so you can argue that one is better than the other based on the ecosystem alone. For that reason, we prefer Google's ecosystem to Amazon's.</p><p>Like any other smart speaker, you can ask it the weather, have it answer random questions, and play white noise at bedtime to help you sleep. It's a great size to squeeze onto a bedside table or even a bathroom counter if you need an alarm clock or shower jams.</p><p>Connects to Google Assistant.</p><p>★ A clock option:We originally preferred theEcho Dot with Clock ($60)simply because it can tell time, thanks to the LED clock added to the front. But Amazon is mostly out of stock, while a lot of other retailers have it at half off, and Amazon has told us they don't plan to restock this generation. Amazon could announce a new generation soon, and we'll update this guide if that happens. The regularEcho Dot (5th Gen) ($50)is still in stock, sans clock.</p><p>Photograph: Sonos</p><p>The pint-size Sonos Roam (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has become our favoritesmart portable speaker. WIRED reviewer Parker Hall has taken it on road trips, to outdoor weddings, and in the basket of his bike. The simple-to-use Sonos ecosystem works with Google Assistant and Alexa, and the speaker has Bluetooth for when you're out of Wi-Fi range. It even includes wireless charging, which makes it the perfect speaker to set down at home between trips outdoors.</p><p>You'll get 10 hours of listening on a full charge at medium volume, and the thing is rugged; an IP67 rating means it can survive in 3 feet of water for 30 minutes. Hall is not easy on speakers, and his review unit is still going strong. If you're looking to up your out-and-about game, buy one of these and stash it inside a stainless to-go mug. Just grab a drink along the way.</p><p>Connects to Google Assistant or Alexa.</p><p>★ Another option:The second generation ofBang & Olufsen's Beosound A1 ($250)added Alexa voice assistant to the mix. It's a beautiful, great-sounding, and durable mono speaker we've had on ourBest Bluetooth Speakerslist for a while, and with Alexa in tow, it's a good portable option for fans of Amazon's voice assistant.</p><p>Photograph: Sonos</p><p>This butt-shaped speaker from Sonos (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best way to hear spatial audio tracks—audio that is mixed with more than two channels and can be projected anywhere in a 3D space. (Apple Music and Amazon Prime Music both offer this.) It can project audio throughout your room and can even be paired witha Sonos soundbarto work as Dolby Atmos surrounds in a home theater.</p><p>Even if you're not listening to spatially mixed audio, the speaker still sounds fantastic. It has big, confident bass and details up top, and it can tune itself to your room using iOS or built-in microphones on the speaker. It's a bit harder to place than the Era 100 above, and is also nearly double the price, but this is still worth considering if you have a larger space or a modern home with a more open floor plan.</p><p>Connects to Alexa, Sonos App, and AirPlay 2. Has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p><p>Photograph: JBL</p><p>JBL’s Authentics 200 smart speaker (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, letting you split between the two for different tasks without having to switch your preference in the app. That makes this speaker particularly appealing for folks with a sprawling collection of smart products from both.</p><p>The 200’s vintage-inspired foam grille and handy control knobs add a sweet retro vibe, but it’s the sound quality that really makes this speaker a winner. We put it head-to-head against some of the best, including the Sonos Era 300 and Era 100, and found it sitting pleasantly in between them, making it among the best-performing smart speakers for the money we’ve heard. With good looks, a big brain, and uncommon versatility, the Authentics 200 is a sharp contender in a crowded field.–Ryan Waniata</p><p>Connects to Alexa and Google Assistant simultaneously, AirPlay 2, and the JBL One app. Has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p><p>There are tons of smart speakers. Here are a few more we like:</p><p>Apple HomePod Mini</p><p>It's cool looking, butApple's HomePod Mini ($99)(6/10, WIRED Review) has the same issues as thelarger HomePod speaker (5/10, WIRED Review), including a higher price than much of the competition and a muddy midrange. It doesn't have anywhere near the level of third-party smart home support you'll find with Amazon or Google. You can get a full-size Nest or Echo speaker for the same money, and you should.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons to love Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, and it works pretty well. If you want to use your voice assistant to shop or use Amazon services like Prime Music or Prime Video, chances are an Alexa-powered speaker is best for you.</p><p>Google Assistant has fewer skills and is compatible with fewer smart home devices than Alexa, but it can do enough to qualify as truly useful, and Google adds new skills fairly frequently. Speakers with Google Assistant work better when you network them together, and they're compatible with a wide variety of Google apps and services. Google is better at answering random questions and telling you where to go out to eat, since it can access and send information to your phone through Google apps.</p><p>Spotify, Pandora, and YouTube Music are the main waysto play musicwith Google Assistant, covering most of your bases. The service can also send Netflix shows and movies to your TV if you have a Chromecast attached.</p><p>If you're using a smart display, we also prefer Google's displays because Alexa Show devices will show you sponsored content. Google's will not. Amazon's Show displays are already crowded with content by default that you'll likely want to remove. (To do so, go to Settings on the device, and then click Home Content. You'll currently find over 40 options you can toggle on and off.) But you can't fully remove the sponsored content unless you're on Photo Frame mode. Meanwhile, Google's displays make for better photo frames thanks to Google Photos, and don't have such a crowded interface of content to distract you. We'd stick to a Nest Home Hub unless you definitely want an Alexa display and won't mind the occasional onscreen ad.</p><p>Amazon will start rolling outthe new and improved Alexa soon, named Alexa+. This second generation of the Alexa voice assistant is supposed to be more conversational, able to execute complex tasks and learn new information, and be much more personalized. That'll be due to its being powered by generative AI.</p><p>Alexa+ will also requireall voice recordings be sent to Amazonto be processed, and Amazon's changing its features for recordings with regular Alexa to go to Amazon, too. There's currently a “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” privacy feature that you can select to have voice requests processed locally, but that feature will be killed on March 28, 2025, per an email Amazon sent out to current users of that feature.</p><p>Alexa+ will be available for $20 a month, or free if you have an Amazon Prime membership. While you likely have a membership if you added an Alexa device to your home, it's a big jump from the previously free assistant (and both versions will have less privacy). Amazon says early access will begin to roll out next month in the US, beginning withEcho Show smart displays, specifically the Echo Show 8, 10, 15, and 21. The privacy change will affect all Echo users, whether or not it's one of these devices or a different model.</p><p>The smart speakers in this guide are all made by large brands—Amazon! Google! Sonos!—and it's unlikely any of them will suddenly vanish or become a useless brick speaker on your desk. There are even some first-generation Amazon Echos still working that are about a decade old (with mixed results,based on what users say online).</p><p>But aUK lawpassed in April 2024 adds more protection here. The law mandates three key things: more secure password procedures, more clarity on how to report bugs and security issues, and that manufacturers and retailers inform customers how long these products will receive support and software updates.</p><p>The last one is the most relevant for smart speaker users, since the fear is you'll buy a speaker that will suddenly stop getting updates and become unusable, like the Sonos issues in 2020. The law is new, and failure to meet these requirements results in fines, so we'll have to wait and see how much information is really offered to shoppers as it takes effect. But it's a law we like.</p>

        <p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>Password managers arethe vegetables of the internet. We know they’re good for us, but most of us are happier snacking on thepassword equivalent of junk food. For nearly a decade, that’s been “123456” and “password”—the twomost commonly used passwordson the web. The problem is, most of us don’t know what makes a good password and aren’t able to remember hundreds of them anyway.</p><p>The safest (if craziest) way to store your passwords is to memorize them all. (Make sure they are long, strong, andsecure!) Just kidding. That might work forMemory Grand Master Ed Cooke, but most of us are not capable of such fantastic feats. We need to offload that work to password managers, which offer secure vaults that can stand in for our memory. The best password manager offers convenience and, more importantly, helps you create better passwords, which makes your online existence less vulnerable to password-based attacks.</p><p>Readour guide to VPN providersfor more ideas on how you can upgrade your security, as well asour guide to backing up your datato make sure you don’t lose anything if the unexpected happens.</p><p>Updated March 2025: We've updated our review of Dashlane based on recent testing, added NordPass back, and have more details on the status of passkey support.</p><p>Power up with unlimited access toWIRED.Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just$2.50$1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content.Subscribe Today.</p><p>Why Not Use Your Browser?</p><p>Most web browsers offer at least a rudimentary password manager. (This is where your passwords are stored when Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox ask if you’d like to save a password.) This is better than reusing the same password everywhere, butbrowser-based password managers are limited. In recent years, Google has improved the password manager built into Chrome, and it's better than the rest, but it's still not as full-featured or widely supported as a dedicated password manager like those below.</p><p>WIRED readers have also asked about Apple’s password manager, which syncs through iCloud and has some nice integrations with the Safari web browser. There’s nothing wrong with Apple’s system. It doesn’t have some of the nice extras you get with dedicated services, but it handles securing your passwords and syncing them between Apple devices. The main problem is that if you have any non-Apple devices, you won’t be able to sync your passwords to them. All in on Apple? Then this is a viable, free, built-in option worth considering.</p><p>What Are Passkeys?</p><p>A concerted effort to get rid of passwords began roughly two days after the password was invented. Passwords are a pain—you’ll get no argument here—but we don’t see them going away in the foreseeable future. The latest effort to eliminate the password comes from theFIDO Alliance, an industry group aimed at standardizing authentication methods online. Does this sound a little bit like the infamousxkcd 927? Yes, yes it does. But thanks to the monopolistic nature of devices, it might work this time.</p><p>Apple supports the FIDO specs and coined the term passkeys, which has caught on. Passkeys are generated cryptographic keys managed by your device (usually your phone). They’re easy to create—you don’t need to do anything, your device handles the details. Your passkeys are stored on your device and protected by either biometrics or PINs. Since passkeys are generated key pairs instead of passwords, there's nothing to remember. If you are familiar withGPG keys, they're somewhat similar in that there's a public and private key; the website you want to log in to has a public key and sends it to your device. Your device compares that to the private key it has and you're signed in (or not if the keys don't match). While passkeys aren't a radical departure, they're still an improvement by virtue of being a preinstalled tool for people who aren't going to read this article and immediately sign up to use one of the services below. If millions of people suddenly stop using 12345678 as a password, that's a win for security.</p><p>Almost all of the apps we've suggested here can store passkeys, which means you can store your passkeys right alongside your passwords. Our two favorites, Bitwarden and 1Password, can generate, save, store, and sync passkeys. You can even log in to Bitwarden using a passkey, which pretty much eliminates the need for a password at all. Once you have a passkey stored, it will automatically sync to all your devices the same way Bitwarden and 1Password sync your passwords. When you return to that site, your password manager will log you in using the passkey you generated.</p><p>Think of passkeys as credit cards next to the cash (passwords) in your wallet. It's possible that one day passkeys will work everywhere and there will be no passwords, no password managers. In the mean time we think it's better to stick with a password manager, even if all you're doing with that manager is storing passkeys.</p><p>Password Manager Perks (and Tips)</p><p>A good password manager stores, generates, and updates passwords for you with the press of a button. If you’re willing to spend a few dollars a month, a password manager can sync your passwords across all of your devices. Here’s how they work.</p><p>Only one password to remember: To access all of your passwords, you only have to remember one password. When you type that into the password manager, it unlocks the vault containing all of your actual passwords. Only needing to remember one password is great, but it means there’s a lot riding on that password. Make sure it’s a good one. If you’re having trouble coming up with that one password to rule them all, check out our guide tobetter password security. You might also consider using theDicewaremethod for generating a strong master password.</p><p>Apps and extensions: Most password managers are full systems, rather than a single piece of software. They consist of apps or browser extensions for each of your devices (Windows, Mac, Android phones, iPhone, and tablets), which have tools to help you create secure passwords, safely store them, and evaluate the security of your existing passwords. All that information is then sent to a central server where your passwords are encrypted, stored, and shared between devices.</p><p>Fixing compromised passwords: While password managers can help you create more secure passwords and keep them safe from prying eyes, they can’t protect your password ifthe website itself is breached. That doesn’t mean they don’t help in this scenario though. All the cloud-based password managers we discuss offer tools to alert you to potentially compromised passwords. Password managers also make it easier to quickly change a compromised password and search through your credentials to ensure you didn’t reuse any compromised passwords.</p><p>You should disable auto form-filling: Some password managers will automatically fill in and even submit web forms for you. This is super convenient, but for additional security, we suggest you disable this feature. Automatically filling forms in the browser has made password managersvulnerable to attacksin the past. For this reason, some, like1Password, require you to opt into this feature. We suggest you do not.</p><p>Don’t panic about hacks: Software has bugs, even your password manager. The question is not what to doifit becomes known that your password manager has a flaw, but what you dowhenit becomes known that your password manager has a flaw. The answer is, first, don’t panic. Normally bugs arefound, reported, and fixed before they’re exploited in the wild. Even if someone does manage to gain access to your password manager’s servers, you should still be fine. All of the services we list store only encrypted data, and none of them store your encryption key, meaning all an attacker gets from compromising their servers is encrypted data.</p><p>Bitwarden (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is secure, open source, and free with no limits. The applications are polished and user-friendly, making the service the best choice for most users. Did I mention it’s open source? That means thecode that powers Bitwardenis freely available for anyone to inspect, seek out flaws, and fix. In theory, the more eyes on the code, the more airtight it becomes. Bitwarden was alsoaudited for 2023 by a third partyto ensure it’s secure. You can install it on a local server for easy self-hosting if you prefer to run your own cloud.</p><p>There are apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as extensions for all major web browsers. Bitwarden also supports Windows Hello and Touch ID on its desktop apps for Windows and macOS, giving users the added security of those biometric authentication systems. The web interface (which I frequently use) recently underwent a redesign, which makes it much cleaner and easier to use.</p><p>Bitwarden supports passwordless authentication, meaning you can log in with a one-time code, biometric authentication, or a security key. Bitwarden also has excellent support for passkeys, including the ability tolog into Bitwarden with a passkey, which means you don't need to use your username or password even to open your vault. There’s also some extras, like a feature to securely share files (calledBitwarden Send), an authenticator app (paid only), and an extremelyactive and helpful community.</p><p>I like Bitwarden’s semi-automated password fill-in tool. If you visit a site you’ve saved credentials for, Bitwarden’s browser icon shows the number of saved credentials from that site. Click the icon, and it will ask which account you want to use and then automatically fill in the login form. This makes it easy to switch between usernames and avoid the pitfalls of autofill. If you simply must have your fully automated form-filling feature, Bitwarden supports that as well.</p><p>Bitwarden offers paid upgrade accounts. The cheapest of the bunch, Bitwarden Premium, is $10 per year. That gets you 1 GB of encrypted file storage and two-factor authentication with devices likeYubiKey, FIDO U2F, and Duo, plus a password hygiene and vault health report. You also get priority customer support with a paid account.</p><p>After signing up,download the appfor Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, or Linux. There are also browser extensions forFirefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge, Vivaldi, and Brave.</p><p>What sets 1Password apart from the other options in this list is the number of extras it offers. Like other password managers, 1Password has apps for every major platform, including macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and ChromeOS. There’s even a command-line tool that will work anywhere. There are plug-ins for your favorite web browser, which makes it easy to generate and edit new passwords on the fly.</p><p>I still find BitWarden to be a more economical choice for most people, but 1Password has some very nice features you won't find elsewhere. If you frequently travel across national borders, you’ll appreciate my favorite perk: Travel Mode. This mode lets you delete any sensitive data from your devices before you travel and then restore it with a click after you’ve crossed a border. This prevents anyone, including law enforcement at international borders, from accessing your complete password vault.</p><p>It's worth noting that 1Password uses a combination of two keys to unlock your account: your password and an additional generated secret key. While that does add a layer of security that will protect against weak passwords, it also means part of what you need to unlock your passwords is something you did not create. 1Password does make sure you have this key as an item in your “emergency kit,” but I still prefer pairing a self-generated password with a Yubikey.</p><p>In addition to being a password manager, 1Password can act as an authentication app likeGoogle Authenticator. For added security, it creates a secret key to the encryption key it uses, meaning no one can decrypt your passwords without that key. The downside is that if you lose this key, no one, not even 1Password, can decrypt your passwords. (This can be mitigated by setting up a custom group with the “Recover Accounts” permission.)</p><p>1Password also offers tight integration with other mobile apps. Rather than copying and pasting passwords from your password manager to other apps (which puts your password on the clipboard, at least for a moment), 1Password is integrated with many apps and can autofill. This is more noticeable on iOS, where inter-app communication is more restricted.</p><p>After signing up,download the appfor Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Chrome OS, or Linux. There are also browser extensions forFirefox, Chrome, Brave, and Edge.</p><p>Dashlane offers most of what you'll find in our other picks. The company doesn’t offer a desktop app, but I primarily use passwords in the web browser anyway, and Dashlane has add-ons for all the major browsers, along with iOS and Android apps. If a desktop app is important to you, that omission is something to be aware of, but in my testing, it isn't a big deal. Dashlane uses the same AES 256-bit encryption in a zero-knowledge system, which means passwords are only ever decrypted on your device. Dashlane uses multifactor authentication if you want, via an authenticator app or a hardware key like the Yubikey.</p><p>Dashlane is considerably more expensive than Bitwarden or 1Password, but that extra money does get you some additional security features, like Site Breach Alerts, which let you know if any web services you use have leaked your data. Dashlane also actively monitors the darker corners of the web, looking for leaked or stolen personal data, and it alerts you if your information has been compromised. There's even a Phishing Alert system that will stop you from entering credentials on a site with a spoofed URL. This last feature is incredibly useful if you happen to be setting up less tech-savvy relatives or friends with a password manager. Dashlane's phishing protection can save them from themselves. Dashlane also offers a VPN throughHotspot Shield VPN. I have not tested the Dashlane integration, but in testing Hotspot Shield on its own, I've always found it too slow torecommend in my VPN guide.</p><p>Setup and migration to Dashlane from another password manager is simple, and you’ll use a secret key to encrypt your passwords, much like BitWarden’s setup process. In practice, Dashlane is very similar to the others on this list. Dashlane offers a 30-day free trial, so you can test it out before committing.</p><p>After signing up,download the appfor Android and iOS, and grab the browser extensions forFirefox, Chrome, and Edge.</p><p>You might know Nord better for its VPN service, but the company also offers a password manager,NordPass, and a pretty nice online storage system,NordLocker. A part of the appeal of NordPass comes in bundling it with the company's other services for some compelling deals. As a password manager, NordPass offers everything you need. It uses a zero-knowledge setup in which all data is encrypted on your device before it’s uploaded to the company’s servers. Unlike most services here, NordPass uses XChaCha20 for encryption. It would require a deep dive into cryptography to get into the differences, but the short story is that it's just as secure and maybe slightly faster.</p><p>There’s also a personal information storage feature to keep your address, phone number, and other personal data safe and secure, but easy to access. NordPass also offers an emergency access feature, which allows you to grant another NordPass user emergency access to your vault. It works just like the same feature in 1Password, allowing trusted friends or family to access your account if you cannot.</p><p>Other nice features include support for two-factor authentication to sign in to your account, as well as security tools to evaluate the strength of your passwords and alert you if any of your data is compromised. Note that NordPass Premium is theoretically $3 a month, but there are always sales that bring that much lower. The downside, and my one gripe about all Nord services, is that there is no monthly plan. As noted above, the best deal comes in combining NordPass, NordVPN, and NordLocker for a bundled deal.</p><p>After signing up,download the appfor Android and iOS, and grab the browser extensions forFirefox, Chrome, and Edge.</p><p>Want to retain more control over your data in the cloud? Sync your password vault yourself. The services below do not store any of your data on their servers. This means attackers have nothing to target. Instead of storing your passwords, these services use a local vault to store your data, and then you can sync that vault using a file-syncing service likeDropbox,NextCloud, or Edward Snowden’srecommended service,SpiderOak. There are two services to keep track of in this scenario, making it a little more complex. But if you’re already using a file-syncing file service, this can be a good option.</p><p>Enpass does not store any data on its servers. Syncing is handled through third-party services. Enpass doesn’t do the syncing, but it does offer apps on every platform. That means once you have syncing set up, it works just like any other service. And you don’t have to worry about Enpass being hacked, because your data isn’t on its servers. Enpass supports syncing through Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, Box, Nextcloud, or any service using WebDAV. Alas, SpiderOak is not currently supported. You can also synchronize your data over a local WLAN or Wi-Fi network.</p><p>All of the features you expect in a password manager are here, including auto-generating passwords, breach-monitoring, biometric login (for devices that support it), auto-filling passwords, and options to store other types of data, like credit cards and identification data. There’s also a password audit feature to highlight any weak or duplicate passwords in your vault. One extra I particularly like is the ability to tag passwords for easier searching. Enpass also makes setting up the syncing through the service of your choice very easy. Enpass recentlyadded support for passkeys.</p><p>Enpass is free to use on Windows, Mac, and Linux.  The mobile version syncs up to 25 items in one vault for free. For more than that, you’ll want to sign up for the paid service.</p><p>After signing up,download the appfor Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS, and grab the browser extensions forChrome, Vivaldi, Edge, and Firefox.</p><p>KeePassXC works like Enpass above. It stores your passwords in an encrypted digital vault that keeps you secure with a master password, a key file, or both. You sync that database file yourself using a file-syncing service. Once your file is in the cloud, you can access it on any device that has a KeePassXC client. Like Bitwarden, KeePassXC is open source, which means its code can be and has been inspected for critical flaws. If you’re an advanced user and comfortable handling your own issues and support, KeePassXC makes a great choice.</p><p>The downside of KeePassXC is that it doesn’t have official mobile clients. However, third-party apps are available for iOS and Android.</p><p>Download thedesktop appfor Windows, macOS, or Linux and create your vault. There are also extensions forFirefox,Edge, andChrome. The project does not offer apps for phones. Instead, it recommendsKeePass2AndroidorStrongbox for iPhone.</p><p>Password managers are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Our top picks cover most use cases and are the best choices for most people, but your needs may be different. Fortunately, there are plenty of good password managers out there. Here are some more we’ve tested and like.</p><p>Keeper Password Manager ($35 Per Year for Unlimited):Keeper offers a variety of security-related tools, including a password manager. Keeper works much like 1Password and others, storing only your encrypted data, and it offers two-factor authentication for logging in to your account. Like Dashlane, Keeper has a lot of extras, including dark-web monitoring, meaning it will check publicly posted data to make sure yours isn’t available.</p><p>RoboForm ($24 Per Year, $48 Per Year for a Five-User Family Plan):RoboForm has most of the same features as the rest on this list, but it lacks some of the things that differentiate our top picks, like Bitwarden’s open source aspect and 1Password’s travel features. I’ve been testing the free plan for a while and haven’t run into any problems. There are apps for every common platform, and it’s easy to use. RoboForm recently completedan independent security auditand came out looking good.</p><p>Pass (Free):Pass is a command-line wrapper around GPG (GNU Privacy Guard), which means it is only for the nerdiest users. It supports managing encrypted .gpg files in Git, and third-party mobile apps are available. It’s not for everyone. For years, this was my password manager of choice, but eventually, Bitwarden's ease of use won me over.</p><p>LastPass ($3 Per Month):LastPass has had morebad security breachesthan any other service on this page, which led us to remove it from our top picks. Since then, the company has changed hands and appears to be better security-wise, which is good because many people still use it. That said, there is nothing about LastPass that makes it a more compelling choice than Bitwarden, 1Password, or the others mentioned in this guide.</p><p>The best and most secure cryptographic algorithms are all available via open source programming libraries. On the one hand, this is great, as any app can incorporate these ciphers and keep your data safe. Unfortunately, any encryption is only as strong as its weakest link, and cryptography alone won’t keep your passwords safe.</p><p>This is what I test for: What are the weakest links? Is your master password sent to the server? Every password managersaysit isn’t, but if you watch network traffic while you enter a password, sometimes you find, well, it is. I also dig into how mobile apps work: Do they, for example, leave your password store unlocked but require a PIN to get back in? That’s convenient, but it sacrifices too much security. No password manager is perfect, but the ones above represent the best I’ve tested. They’re as secure as they can be while remaining easy to use.</p>

    <h1>Review: Sony PlayStation DualSense Edge Controller</h1>

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.</p><p>8/10</p><p>You don't needSony's DualSense Edge controller for yourPlayStation 5orPS5 Pro. At $199, it's a luxury purchase by any measure. But there's a good chance you mightwantone all the same—two years from release, and months after Sony's flagshipPS5 Pro debut, thispro-tier controlleris still a strong contender for thebest way to playon the all-conquering console.</p><p>Sony knows it's an expensive peripheral and, accordingly, makes everything about the Edge stand out. It's a showcase from the first time you open the packaging, a sturdy lid opening like a music box, revealing a striking pearlescent carrying case (it also comes in black). This houses the controller itself and a host of components with which to customize it—four alternate thumbstick heads with rounded caps, two with longer sticks; two pairs of optional rear buttons, one lever-type paddles, the other half-dome switches; a 3-meter-long braided USB-A to USB-C cable, and a special locking attachment to stop said cable getting yanked out of the controller during play.</p><p>The case also has a few clever features, like an elevated rest that supports the controller with those rear buttons attached, saving you the hassle of detaching them each time. A Velcro porthole allows you to charge the pad in situ. Everything about the design feels premium, so is it worth the splurge?</p><p>The DualSense Edge's bevy of components is similar to the modular add-ons that accompany a lot of otherpro-level controllers, but this eases you into using all the extra bits and pieces. Pick it up for the first time, and it's not distinct from thestandard DualSensethat comes with the PS5, the only overt difference being the new function (“Fn”) buttons that sit under the familiar thumbstick.</p><p>Rotate the pad in your hands and you'll notice the slots to insert those optional rear buttons, and small sliders to manually adjust how deep a squeeze you get on the L2/R2 triggers, locking them into mid or short pulls. Otherwise, it wouldn't be unreasonable for a casual gamer to think it's just another PS5 controller, especially when the controller's haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and built-in audio features are more or less unchanged.</p><p>Sony PS5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>Look a little closer and it reveals finer details though, from a greater use of black in its monochromatic color scheme—the D-pad and iconic circle, cross, triangle, and square face buttons are now set in a contrasting black, as is the central touchpad—further accented by hundreds of those signature icons with a glossy highlight that beautifully catches the light against the matte surface. The underside continues to have a slightly roughened microtexture (tens of thousands of the PlayStation icons etched in at a microscopic scale) to provide a firmer grip.</p><p>The Edge has a little more heft than its standard sibling, weighing around 325 grams, a touch heavier than the original's 280 grams, but it's not unwieldy. The Fn buttons don't get in the way, but the rear buttons might when attached. The longer paddle-type ones felt more natural, while the half-dome switches—imagine a single thumbstick, sliced in half, then stuck on the back with the rim sticking out—were a bit too uncomfortable, though they did offer an oddly satisfying click. Whichever type of rear button you connect doesn't affect function, only form, so it comes down to what you like.</p><p>It's when you first connect it to your PS5 to sync with the console that you start to see just how different the DualSense Edge can be. Sony's software integration is fantastic—the console automatically detects the controller and launches a guided tour of how to set it up and create your first custom profile. For anyone dipping their toes into the waters of pro controllers, this is a great touch—remapping an entire controller can be daunting, but this makes it seem slick and intuitive.</p><p>Almost everything can be tweaked, and mirrored functions can be assigned to those rear button slots—as in, a rear paddle can be set to do the same thing as pressing square, but the square and triangle inputs can't be combined into one. It's worth noting that any new layouts you create won't affect in-game prompts, so if you're being told to press circle, it's on you to remember which button you may have reassigned tobethe circle button.</p><p>Sony PS5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>Going deeper, you can also tailor the dead zones of the thumbsticks and sensitivity of the triggers, adjusting resting positions, and with a range of presets, determining how rapidly onscreen movements occur with how much pressure you apply. You can save up to four schemes to a quick menu accessed by holding down those new Fn buttons, and the same menu also allows you to quickly adjust audio, either raising or lowering volume, or adjusting the balance between game and chat audio. If you find that a layout you've created isn't working right in-game, you can customize it directly from the Fn menu. Pro-level features for a pro-level pad.</p><p>I've mainly been using the customized layouts for Capcom'sMonster Hunter Wilds,and it's made a real difference, particularly for combat. Something in my brain cannot latch onto the game's default attacks being mapped to the circle and triangle buttons. Too many other action games have left me with muscle memory that the square button should be attack, but onWilds,that instead sheathes your currently equipped weapon, far from ideal when a giant dragon is bearing down on you. While some elements of the control scheme can be modified in-game, custom remapping isn't possible. Instead, I created a quick profile for the Edge, swapping the circle, triangle, and square inputs around, and I've been happily hammering away at the square button to gut any pesky monsters crossing my path ever since.</p><p>Annoyingly, another part of my brain prefersWilds'default controls when out of battle (I contain multitudes). There, the circle button does helpful things like canceling menu selections, butthatfeels wrong if I keep it mapped to the square button. Helpfully, the Edge lets you switch control profiles immediately by holding down one of the Fn buttons below the thumbstick and selecting another layout, with the system default mapped to triangle. Perfect. When I set out on one ofMonster Hunter'slengthy, combat-heavy quests, I can swap to a control system I click with. During quieter sections in villages or base camps—or even whenever I need to do a lot of menu diving—I can swap back to default layouts without ever having to close the game. The Fn+[face button] combo has earned its spot in my muscle memory, making the game feel even more accessible.</p><p>Sony PS5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>Those customizable rear buttons, whichever form you opt for, can feel like a great alternative to using face buttons or shoulder triggers for things like manual gear shifts in racing games. I also created one layout that mirrored the L2 and R2 triggers to the back paddles, and although that meant forsaking the DualSense's adaptive trigger functions (when they resist your input, often used for haptic tricks like pulling a bow string) and rendering the physically adjustable trigger distance of the Edge almost pointless, it allowed me to more comfortably have fingers at the ready for all four shoulder button inputs, which I found useful on a variety of games, from action games such asStellar Bladeto shooters likeHelldivers 2. We're talking fractions of a difference, but if you're a competitive gamer, that can mean a lot.</p><p>Arguably, the killer feature is modular thumbsticks. An almost vanishingly small release tab on the base pops off a faceplate, allowing either left or right thumbstick to be removed and replaced (available separately forabout $20). The Edge's case has an empty slot ready and waiting for you to pop a spare in. On the surface, this is great—sure, the Edge is $199, but a $20 replacement part if it develops stick drift is cheaper than buying an entire regularDualSense at $70a pop, right?</p><p>However, given that premium pricing, it's disappointing that Sony didn't go forHall effect thumbstickson the Edge in the first place. These are frequently found inhigher-end third-party pro controllersand use magnetic sensors to track a thumbstick's position. Not only is it a far more accurate technology, but Hall effect sticks don't degrade, as there's no friction or erosion of sensor surfaces internally, which causes drift in most regular joypads. If Sony used the modular nature to sell higher-grade Hall effect sticks separately, it would be somewhat understandable—under the cold light of capitalism, it'd be another thing to sell—but there's no sign of that happening. While third-party Hall effect mods can be found, it feels like an oversight, if not a deliberate omission, on Sony's part.</p><p>The same modularity also means less space for the controller's battery. The Edge has a 1,050-mAh battery cell, compared to the 1,560-mAh one in the conventional DualSense. This unavoidably means shorter play cycles between charges, although exactly how long will depend on the game. For many, this is where that extraordinarily long braided cable will come in handy, allowing you to keep playing longer.</p><p>There are a few other, smaller gripes with the Edge. It feels odd that the taller pair of swappable thumbstick caps are only available in the older, rounded form, while the modern, slightly recessed style used since PS4 only gets a default shorter pair. Similarly, the fact that there's only capacity for two rear buttons, when many pro pads accommodate four, may feel a bit lackluster.</p><p>The overall quality of the Edge is undeniable, though, and its balance of gentle onboarding for pro controller newcomers with advanced features for more demanding players is exceptional. It makes for a much better way to play, but the daunting price means you'll pay for the privilege.</p><p>Sony PS5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p>

It's convenient to ask anAmazon EchoorGoogle Nest speakerto play your favorite track or tell you the weather, but smart speakers require stable Wi-Fi and potential privacy compromises. By (mostly) forgoing voice assistants and Wi-Fi radios, Bluetooth speakers are ultraportable, able to venture into the world and withstand rugged conditions like a sandy beach or steamy Airbnb jacuzzi. They'll provide worry-free connection to any smartphone, and the top options sound as good as or better than the average smart speaker.</p><p>We've tested hundreds of Bluetooth speakers going back to 2017, and they improve every year. Today's models are designed for nearly every use case you can imagine, which is exactly how we test them. Here are our favorites right now. Be sure to check out all ourbuying guides, including theBest Soundbars,Best Wirefree Earbuds,Best Smart Speakers, andBest Bookshelf Speakers.</p><p>Updated March 2025: We've added the JBL Flip 7 and JBL Charge 6.</p><p>Power up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just$2.50$1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content.Subscribe Today.</p><p>Compromise isn't great for your principles but it's essential for portable Bluetooth speakers. JBL’s Flip strikes the perfect compromise between mobility and sound quality, offering clean detail with plenty of punch in a durable, droppable, and utterly portable package. The Flip 7 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) provides new goodies like increased water resistance, an easy-release strap, and a two-hour battery boost (or four with reduced bass).</p><p>The latest Flip also supportsAuracastto sync with other new JBL models like theClip 5and Charge 6. Auracast may provide future connectivity benefits, but it leaves the latest speakers unable to connect with older ones, so if you already have a family of older JBLs it may make more sense to go with the previousFlip 6. Otherwise, the Flip 7 is a killer speaker that happily tags along on virtually any adventure you can muster. —Ryan Waniata</p><p>14-16 hours of battery life, USB-C charging (cable not included), IP68 dust/water resistance</p><p>★360 Alternative:If you’re after a speaker with a wider and more expansive soundstage, UE’s Boom 4 (8/10, Wired Recommends) is a great alternative. Its 360-degree soundstage offers great performance from any angle, and though it doesn’t have the same bass thump as the Flip 7, its clear and balanced sound provides smooth definition across your catalog.</p><p>The largerSonos speakersare great if you want a speaker that usually lives inside, but they aren't the kind of thing you'd want to throw in a backpack. That's where the Roam 2 comes in (9/10, WIRED Recommends). This tiny tube has all the same smarts as its bigger Sonos siblings but with an IP67 dust- and water-resistance rating and 10 hours of listening time. It's about the size of a 16-ounce beer can and easily fits in cup holders and knapsacks alike. Sonos recently updated it with easier Bluetooth pairing via a dedicated button.—Parker Hall</p><p>10-hour battery life, USB-C charging (available wireless charging pad), IP67 dust/water resistance</p><p>★A bigger portable Sonos:TheSonos Move 2 costs $449(8/10, WIRED Recommends) and is a larger version of our top pick, the Sonos Roam. It's good if you're trying to fuel a real dance party, or if you want a mostly indoor speaker you can take onto the patio for get-togethers.</p><p>This sub-$100 speaker from Sony has become a go-to when riding to gatherings, thanks to a clever built-in strap, and the fact that it sits flat in a bike basket. It's got excellent battery life, is IP67-rated for dust and water resistance, and you can even link two of them together for stereo sound. It comes in a variety of awesome colors—my favorites include bright blue and orange—so you'll never be lost in the crowd. At just under 4 inches tall, it's small enough to take virtually anywhere, and it sounds a lot better than a speaker this size has a right to.—Parker Hall</p><p>16-hour battery life, USB-C charging, IP67 dust/water resistance</p><p>Tribit’s line of Bluetooth speakers sound a lot better than they should for the price. The StormBox is our favorite line. The new StormBox 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is largely the same as the original model, with dual-firing drivers and passive radiators in a 7-inch-long pill shape, but now it comes with upgraded controls and about 6 watts more output (up to 30 watts from 24). No, it can't fuel a trance dance party on its own, but its clarity is impressive, and it has a fun extra bass button that adds some surprising, if slightly muddy, thump.</p><p>With 24-ish hours of battery and anIPX7 waterproof rating—which means it's not dust-proof but can be submerged in water—it's a great companion for backyard tunes, a trip down the river, or other informal gatherings.—Parker Hall</p><p>24-hour battery life, USB-C charging, IPX7 water resistance</p><p>If packability isn’t of top concern, the 9-inch-tall Megaboom 4 is one of the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy. It's got rich and full 360-degree sound with plenty of low-end punch. Its drop-tested, weatherproof body is ready for any outing, from surf to sand, and it offers over 150 feet of wireless range and up to 20 hours of battery life (more like 15 hours at volume). As with other UE speakers, the app adds features like the ability to connect multiple speakers in a group or two Megaboom 4s in stereo, adjust the EQ, and wake the speaker from sleep. This rugged sound pillar is key to my backyard jams and well worth adding to your semi-mobile arsenal. —Ryan Waniata</p><p>20-hour battery life, USB-C charging, IP67 dust/water resistance</p><p>JBL’s latest Charge speaker offers big and beautiful sound from its football-shaped frame. As you'd guess, the Charge's marquee feature is its ability to top off other devices via its USB-C port, and its beefy battery makes it well positioned to do so. Like the new Flip, the speaker can be plugged in for lossless playback on supported devices and uses Auracast to sync up with other new JBL models, though that leaves out older versions like theCharge 5.</p><p>The Charge isn't as easy to pack as our top pick, weighing 3 pounds and stretching 9 inches across, but if you bring it along you’ll be rewarded with clear, full, andloudsound with plenty of bass. A new removable strap offers a more convenient way to carry it, but mine arrived broken, so I’m not overly confident about its longevity. Strap and size aside, the Charge is an impressively loaded speaker for its price, with enough bravado to pump up crowded campgrounds or backyard parties. —Ryan Waniata</p><p>24-28 hours of battery life, USB-C charging (cable not included), IP68 dust/water resistance</p><p>Tribit has been raising its game in the portable audio category, and the Stormbox Flow (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is another great example of the brand’s portable prowess. The headline here is a rival-stomping 30 hours of max battery life, but the Flow has plenty more to give, from an elegant yet weatherproof design to clear and punchy audio with thumpy bass to match. Maybe the speaker’s best feature is its low price of $80 or less, making it a fine fit for budget shoppers seeking a versatile option that keeps rocking long after the party dies. —Ryan Waniata</p><p>30-hour battery life, USB-C charging, IP67 dust/water resistance</p><p>JBL’s Clip 5 speaker is a tad pricey for a micro-size portable, but this is a classic case of getting what you pay for. I think of the sound as “fat” in a good way, with fuller bass and midrange frequencies than expected. The warmer sound still offers rich detail and definition, and you can adjust the sound in the JBL Portable app. I love using the speaker in the shower or even clipping its wide carabiner on my belt loop for yard work. Its stout body is dust- and water-resistant, and adds advanced features like the ability to stereo-pair two Clip 5s or connect to newer JBL speakers via Auracast. Battery life is still middling, but a two-hour boost over the previous Clip (five extra hours with Playtime Boost) provides a solid upgrade that makes the Clip 5 more versatile than ever. —Ryan Waniata</p><p>12-hour battery life (15 hours with Boost), USB-C Charging, IP67 dust/water resistance</p><p>Brane Audio's Brane X speaker (9/10, WIRED Recommends) may seem like a shockingly spendy choice for a portable speaker, and it certainly is that. But this lunchbox-sized bomber has something no other portable we've tested has: A true, fully functional subwoofer. Thanks to Brane's mystifying RAD (Repel Attract Driver) technology, the Brane X hitsallthe notes in your music, with unadulterated bass to bring more punch, gravitas, and sheer emotionality to everything you play.</p><p>The physics-defying sub joins five drivers up top for impressive stereo expansion for a portable package. You'll get both Bluetooth streaming and Wi-Fi, with support for AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect. The speaker lasts up to 12 hours per charge, and adds solid dust and water resistance. The price is lofty, but less so now that the brand has permanently dropped it by $100. If you can afford the splurge, Brane X's clear and fantastically full sound gets you very close to the performance of a home audio system virtually anywhere you roam. —Ryan Waniata</p><p>12-hour battery life, proprietary charging, IP57 dust/water resistance</p><p>We loved the first generation of the Tribit StormBox Micro for its easy-to-use silicone strap, which firmly held it against bicycle handlebars. In this update, Tribit has maintained the rugged IP67 rating against water and dust, and given us more battery life (around 12 hours), plus better bass. Also, the new Bluetooth 5.2 tech allows it to cast a wider signal than its predecessor, for when you're wandering around the yard or house.—Parker Hall</p><p>12-hour battery life, USB-C charging, IP67 dust/water resistance</p><p>★ Also handlebar-ready:Bose makes a great speaker of a similar design called theSoundLink Micro ($119), which was previously our top bike handlebar pick. It sounds about the same but is twice as expensive as the Tribit.</p><p>Positive Grid's Spark Mini (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite portable tools for musicians. You can pair your phone and play music via the cube-shaped speaker, but also plug in a guitar and blend yourself in to jam along. It's a perfect playing tool for campfires and backyard barbecues (eight hours of battery), and it even doubles as an audio interface if you need to scratch down an idea quickly. Because it's a guitar amp, the thing is much louder than it looks, easily able to fuel sing-alongs and shredding interpretations ofThe Star-Spangled Banneron Independence Day.—Parker Hall</p><p>8-hour battery life, USB-C charging, no labeled water resistance</p><p>★Miniaturize it:Looking for a smaller way to shred on the go? TheSpark Go ($129)is about half the size of the Spark Mini and comes with all the same great sounds, making it perfect for those who don't need much volume (or who plan to practice with headphones anyway).</p><p>The Bose SoundLink Max (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has quickly become my favorite speaker to drag along to outdoor events. It's not quite as big as the boombox that John Cusack would hold over his head in the 1980s, but this robust, rubberized speaker has bold sound and gets loud enough to woo your sweethearts with a love song. I also like that you can plug in your phone while it plays music, which is nice for those of us who are forgetful on our days off. Bold bass, even when outside, makes this good for dance parties in the middle of nowhere, and the handle is easy to tie up to packs, kayaks, or tents.—Parker Hall</p><p>20-hour battery life, USB-C charging, IP67 dust/water resistance</p><p>Apple’s latest Beats Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) loads up on features to make it surprisingly versatile. Quick one-touch pairing for both Apple and Android devices makes this an excellent speaker for folks in mixed-phone homes, while old-school callbacks like a built-in speakerphone and the ability to charge other devices can come in handy. Beats didn’t stop there, offering massive playtime, great dust and water resistance, and the ability to play lossless audio over USB-C with supported devices.</p><p>New drivers provide the slick treble and hefty bass you expect from Beats, but with a refined clarity and punctual definition to soup up everything you play. The design isn’t quite as robust as our top pick, but if you’re looking for big, polished sound and plenty of extras, the Pill delivers it in a posh package.—Ryan Waniata</p><p>24-hour battery life, USB-C Charging, IP67 dust/water resistance</p><p>With 24 hours of battery life, a rugged design, and a huge yard-filling sound, the Ultimate Ears Hyperboom (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the perfect speaker for a party. Intelligent algorithms use data from a built-in mic to analyze where you've placed the speaker, ensuring the best possible sound, much like the Sonos Move. This is a better option than the Sonos if you have no interest in a future home network of speakers.</p><p>It doesn't have lights or cup holders like some other party speakers, but this is the best-made large Bluetooth speaker we've tested.

    <h1>How a Cup of Tea Laid the Foundations for Modern Statistical Analysis</h1>

        <p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>In the early1920s, a trio of scientists sat down for a break at Rothamsted agricultural research station in Hertfordshire, UK. One of them, a statistician by the name of Ronald Fisher, poured a cup of tea, then offered it to his colleague Muriel Bristol, an algae specialist who would later have the plantC. muriellanamed after her. Bristol refused, as she liked to put the milk in before the tea. Fisher was skeptical. Surely it didn’t matter? Yes, she said, it did. A cup with milk poured first tasted better.</p><p>“Let’s test her,” chipped in the third scientist, who also happened to be Bristol’s fiancé. That raised the question of how to assess her tasting abilities. They would need to make sure she was given both types of tea, so she could make a fair comparison. They settled on pouring several cups, some tea-then-milk and others milk-then-tea, then getting her to try them one at a time. But there were still a couple of problems. Bristol might try to anticipate the sequence they’d chosen, which meant cups needed to arrive in a genuinely random order. And even if the ordering was random, she might get a few correct by chance. So there would need to be enough cups to ensure this was sufficiently unlikely.</p><p>Fisher realized that if they gave her six cups—three with milk first and three with milk second—there were 20 different ways they could be randomly ordered. Therefore, if she simply guessed, one in 20 times she’d get all six correct. What about using eight cups instead? In this situation, Fisher calculated there were 70 possible combinations, meaning there was a one in 70—or 1.4 percent—probability she’d get the sequence right by sheer luck. This was the experiment they decided to run with Bristol. They poured eight cups, four of each type, and got her to test them in a random order. She named the four she preferred, and the four she disliked, then they compared her conclusions with the true pattern. She’d got all eight correct.</p><p>Buy this book at:</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism.Learn more.</p><p>The reason for Bristol’s success was ultimately down to chemistry. In 2008, the Royal Society of Chemistry reported that tea-then-milk will give the milk a more burnt flavour. “If milk is poured into hot tea, individual drops separate from the bulk of the milk and come into contact with the high temperatures of the tea for enough time for significant denaturation to occur,”they noted. “This is much less likely to happen if hot water is added to the milk.”</p><p>Fisher later described the tea-tasting experiment in a 1935 book titled simplyThe Design of Experiments. Among other things, the book summarized the crucial techniques they’d pioneered in that Rothamsted tea room. One was the importance of randomization; it wouldn’t have been a rigorous test of Bristol’s ability if the ordering of the cups was somehow predictable. Another was how to arrive at a scientific conclusion. Fisher’s basic statistical recipe was simple: start with an initial theory—he called it the “null hypothesis”—then test it against data. In the Rothamsted tea room, Fisher’s null hypothesis had been that Bristol couldn’t tell the difference between tea-then-milk and milk-then-tea. Her success in the resulting experiment showed Fisher had good reason to discard his null hypothesis.</p><p>But what if she’d only got seven out of eight correct? Or six, or five? Would that mean the null hypothesis was correct and she couldn’t tell the difference at all? According to Fisher, the answer was no. “It should be noted that the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation,” he later wrote. “Every experiment may be said to exist only in order to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis.” If Bristol had got one or two wrong, it didn’t necessarily mean she had zero ability to distinguish milk order. It just meant the experiment hadn’t provided strong enough evidence to reject Fisher’s initial view that it made no difference.</p><p>If Fisher wanted experiments to challenge null hypotheses, he needed to decide where to set the line. Statistical findings have traditionally been deemed “significant” if the probability of obtaining a result that extreme by chance (i.e. the p-value) is less than 5 percent. But why did a p-value of 5 percent become such a popular threshold?</p><p>It came down to a combination ofcopyright and convenience. In a 1908 paper, the statistician William Sealy Gosset had investigated how randomness in data could influence data analysis, with the paper containing pages of statistical tables on the influence of randomness. Fisher was keen to draw upon this research, but was cautious about lifting the copyrighted tables directly. So instead he reframed them, and found that a suitable p-value for determining statistical significance suggested by the work—of around 4.6 percent—lined up neatly with some calculations he had already been doing. It was easy to round it up to 5 percent.</p><p>When Muriel Bristol picked those cups, there was a 1.4 percent chance she would get that many correct. In Fisher’s eyes, this provided “significant” evidence that his null hypothesis was wrong. As hewould later put it, a p-value below 5 percent meant “either an exceptionally rare chance has occurred or the theory is not true.”</p><p>The statistical comparison used in that tea-room experiment would become known as “Fisher’s exact test,” but not everyone was convinced Fisher had got his approach exactly right. In his experiments, Fisher was interested in testing whether the null hypothesis was wrong, not in deciding which hypothesis was correct. Suppose Muriel Bristol had got a couple of cups wrong. On balance, should we conclude that she couldn’t tell the difference? Or that she could? As we’ve seen, Fisher’s test dodges making a choice in this situation; it doesn’t come to any conclusion.</p><p>Statisticians Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson (the son of Karl Pearson, who first coined the p-value)didn’t think this was good enough. If they started with two hypotheses—such as whether someone can or can’t tell the difference between cups of tea—they didn’t want a method that refuses to choose. According to Neyman and Pearson, researchers need a way to decide which hypothesis to accept and which to reject.</p><p>This decision-based attitude to statistics is analogous to the approach taken in legal cases. Much like legal decisions, Neyman and Pearson’s approach requires us to decide on the burden of proof: faced with a particular piece of evidence, how skeptical should we be? If we’re easily persuaded, we’ll end up accepting many hypotheses, whether or not they’re true. In contrast, if we set the bar for evidence very high, we’ll throw out most hypotheses that are false, but also disregard many that are true.</p><p>To deal with this trade-off, Neyman and Pearson introduced two concepts that would go on to plague statistics students: type I and type II errors. The first error occurs when we incorrectly accept the false hypothesis; the second happens when we incorrectly reject the true hypothesis.</p><p>Consider the Blackstone ratio, which suggests that it’s better to have 10 guilty people incorrectly released than have one innocent person imprisoned. In essence, the ratio is saying that, when it comes to criminal justice, the chance of a type I error should be 10 times smaller than the chance of a type II error. In medical studies, a ratio 4 is commonly used instead: the popular threshold for a type I error is a probability of 5 percent (thanks to Fisher) but 20 percent for a type II error. We don’t want to miss a treatment that works, but wereallydon’t want to conclude that a treatment works when it doesn’t.</p><p>Fisher did not take Neyman and Pearson’s criticisms well. In response, he called their methods “childish” and “absurdly academic.” In particular, Fisher disagreed with the idea of deciding between two hypotheses, rather than calculating the “significance” of available evidence, as he’d proposed. Whereas a decision is final, his significance tests gave only a provisional opinion, which could be later revised. Even so, Fisher’s appeal for an open scientific mind was somewhat undermined by his insistence that researchers should use a 5 percent cutoff for a “significant” p-value, and his claim that he would “ignore entirely all results which fail to reach this level.”</p><p>Acrimony would give way to decades of ambiguity, as textbooks gradually muddled together Fisher’s null hypothesis testing with Neyman and Pearson’s decision-based approach. A nuanced debate over how to interpret evidence, with discussion of statistical reasoning and design of experiments, instead became a set of fixed rules for students to follow.</p><p>Mainstream scientific research would come to rely on simplistic p-value thresholds and true-or-false decisions about hypotheses. In this role-learned world, experimental effects were either present or they were not. Medicines either worked or they didn’t. It wouldn’t be until the 1980s that major medical journals finally started breaking free of these habits.</p><p>Ironically, much of the shift can be traced back to an idea that Neyman coined in the early 1930s. With economies struggling in the Great Depression, he’d noticed there was growing demand for statistical insights into the lives of populations. Unfortunately, there were limited resources available for governments to study these problems. Politicians wanted results in months—or even weeks—and there wasn’t enough time or money for a comprehensive study. As a result, statisticians had to rely on sampling a small subset of the population. This was an opportunity to develop some new statistical ideas. Suppose we want to estimate a particular value, like the proportion of the population who have children. If we sampled 100 adults at random and none of them are parents, what does this suggest about the country as a whole? We can’t say definitively that nobody has a child, because if we sampled a different group of 100 adults, we might find some parents. We therefore need a way of measuring how confident we should be about our estimate. This is where Neyman’s innovation came in. He showed that we can calculate a “confidence interval” for a sample which tells us how often we should expect the true population value to lie in a certain range.</p><p>Confidence intervals can be a slippery concept, given they require us to interpret tangible real-life data by imagining many other hypothetical samples being collected. Like those type I and type II errors, Neyman’s confidence intervals address an important question, just in a way that often perplexes students and researchers. Despite these conceptual hurdles, there is value in having a measurement that can capture the uncertainty in a study. It’s often tempting—particularly in media and politics—to focus on a single average value. A single value might feel more confident and precise, but ultimately it is an illusory conclusion. In some of our public-facing epidemiological analysis, my colleagues and I have therefore chosen to report only the confidence intervals, to avoid misplaced attention falling on specific values.</p><p>Since the 1980s, medical journals have put more focus on confidence intervals rather than standalone true-or-false claims. However, habits can be hard to break. The relationship between confidence intervals and p-values hasn’t helped. Suppose our null hypothesis is that a treatment has zero effect. If our estimated 95 percent confidence interval for the effect doesn’t contain zero, then the p-value will be less than 5 percent, and based on Fisher’s approach, we will reject the null hypothesis. As a result, medical papers are often less interested in the uncertainty interval itself, and instead more interested in the values it does—or doesn’t—contain. Medicine might be trying to move beyond Fisher, but the influence of his arbitrary 5 percent cutoff remains.</p><p>Excerpt adapted fromProof: The Uncertain Science of Certainty,by Adam Kucharski.

I took a deep dive into the world of greens powders, speaking with dietitians and trying popular brands to uncover whether or not they're worth the money—and if so, which ones are.</p><p>In short, greens powders aren’t harmful, but ultimately, dietitians agree (see below) that they're not a replacement for a healthy, varied diet. You need to eat your greens, plain and simple. Your body needs fruits and veggies.</p><p>For most people, greens powders are going to be an expensive product that may or may not help them. But if you’re someone who doesn’t eat enough fruits and veggies, and you speak with your doctor beforehand to ensure the ingredients are safe based on your own medical history and needs, greens powders may help bridge the gap. They’re sort of like multivitamins (which are also unregulated by the FDA)—your body will take what it needs and flush the rest down the toilet. And if you don’t know what your body is lacking, the best and likely least expensive course of action is to go to the doctor and figure it out before you start throwing vitamin spaghetti at the wall that is your overall health.</p><p>Ultimately, you (and your doctor!) should figure out which powder—if any—is best for your needs. But I’ve tried a ton of them. And I have noticed better, smoother digestion; heightened energy levels; and a general sense of wellness. I love fruits and veggies, but I also tend to eat like a 5-year-old with access to grown-up money. One personal anecdote that may be useful is that drinking a greens smoothie in the morning makes mefeelhealthier all day. You know how when you have a super healthy meal for lunch, you think more carefully about what you’ll have for dinner? Greens powders make me consider my choices carefully all day long. I drink more water, I eat more mindfully, and I feel like a Fitness Queen much more so than on the days where I wait until 4 pm to eat anything but coffee.</p><p>I think greens powders make sense for me as a supplement, but I refuse to be separated from my kale salads and fruit plates. Or my Hot Cheetos. Life is about balance, after all.</p><p>Updated March 2025: We’ve added three new greens powders from Nourish, Primal Greens, and Organifi.

I mixed the recommended serving size with 10 to 12 ounces of cold water. I tested one powder at a time before moving to the next a few days later.</p><p>Experts Weigh In</p><p>Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist atConsumer Health Digest, says that while greens powders may be beneficial when used in addition to a healthy diet, they fail to provide your body with adequate dietary fiber, and they’re not a substitute for a poor eating pattern. She’d recommend spending your money on “whole foods that contain ample sources of dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, over green powders.” She also says that if you like the convenience of greens powders, “you might find frozen, canned, and pre-washed/chopped options helpful to boost your veggie intake.”</p><p>Dawn Menning, a registered dietitian and director for digital health with the Nutu App, agrees, saying that, “According to the CDC, only 10 percent of American adults meet the dietary recommendations for fruits and vegetables. With that in mind, green powders may be a convenient way for some individuals to fill in these nutritional gaps. But green powders shouldn’t replace eating whole fruits and vegetables.” She adds that if you already eat a healthy variety of fruits and veggies, “you probably don’t need a green powder.”</p><p>One thing to consider in the “pro” category: PerTrista Best, a registered dietitian at Balance One Supplements, “green powder supplements can be beneficial for vegetarians” because they can help fill nutritional gaps, especially regarding iron. She says, “Iron is one key nutrient that may be lacking in a vegetarian diet. While iron is found in a variety of plant-based foods, it is not as easily absorbed by the body as the iron found in meat.”</p><p>And when it comes to “super” ingredients, a word often emblazoned across the packaging of various greens powders, like spirulina or adaptogens, Balls says that there are some possible benefits but that there isn’t an abundance of research that supports their use. And some of these ingredients can interact with certain medications or trigger autoimmune disorders.</p><p>Bloom is the brand I’ve used the longest. Senior commerce editor Kat Merck also drank Bloom for a long time. I’ve tried a few different flavors of Bloom greens, including Strawberry Kiwi (a hit!), Mango (a huge miss!), and Pineapple (somewhere in the middle). I didn’t think it was too sweet until I started trying other brands for this guide. The flavors can be quite saccharine in comparison to other brands and have left me with an artificial taste in my mouth. They don’t taste bad—they just lean too sweet for me, even if I dilute the powder more than it calls for.</p><p>Each serving has 20 calories, 4 grams of cabohydrates, 2 grams of dietary fiber, 150 percent of your daily Vitamin B12, 3 percent of your daily iron, and very low sodium. There are pre- and probiotics, fruits and veggies, antioxidants, adaptogens, and digestive enzymes. I did notice that Bloom’s powders helped me feel less bloated, and they helped regulate some of my digestive issues. And I do like the tub packaging, which doesn’t take up too much room on my counter and is easier to use than bulky bags. Ultimately, if you don’t want your greens to taste like greens, Bloom is worth checking out.</p><p>I tried the Wild Strawberry Kiwi flavor of Groove, which tasted fantastic—fresh, sweet, bright—and the Ginger Peach flavor, which was a little spicy, a little sweet, and reminded me of a wellness juice shot. Both were delicious. One thing I will say is that the scoop design has a little groove on the back that collects powder and makes things a bit messy, so I recommend storing the scoop outside of the powder bag. It also took a little bit longer to dissolve than some other brands I tried. But it tastes like a mocktail or a bottled juice, not like a supplement.</p><p>Each serving contains 20 calories, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of fiber, your daily values of vitamins C and D, a ton of Vitamin B12, plus 8 percent of your daily iron.  There are superfoods, vitamins, minerals, fiber (not much, but it’s there), antioxidants, probiotics, and digestive enzymes. The brand touts Alpha GPC (a form of choline), freeze-dried coconut water, and of course the ever-buzzy superfoods like various grasses and spirulina. I noticed higher energy levels than with other greens powders I tried, less bloating, and happier digestion. Let it be known that these greens don’t taste like fruits or veggies at all, really. If you want your greens to taste more green, another brand might be a better option. But for me, this hit the spot.</p><p>You’ve probably seen commercials for AG1 on YouTube or social media. The sleek, minimalist branding makes it feel elite compared to some other brands. And the same thought is put into the packaging—my AG1 kit came complete with a metal scoop and a slick metal storage canister. AG1 is unique because the powder requires refrigeration due to the live probiotics and whole-food ingredients. The canister makes it feel a little more luxe than other stuff that lives on your kitchen counter. Just be aware that it will be crazy dusty in your kitchen when you dump the pack of greens into the canister. I also got a sleek plastic shaker bottle that worked fine. It wasn’t as good as my dedicated shaker bottle, but it was easy to hold and certainly made melookmore like a world-class athlete.</p><p>AG1 has a strange flavor that’s hard to describe. It sort of tastes milky, fruity, vegetable-y, and meaty? All at once? It’s not unpleasant, but it definitely tastes like Health Food. The company says it tastes like vanilla and pineapple, and you’ll also get notes of papaya, broccoli, cherry, carrot, and a bit of stevia. There are no artificial flavors, sweeteners, or additives. I don’t think it tastes bad at all. It just tastes healthy. Each serving contains 50 calories, 6 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of fiber, 2 grams of protein, and very low sodium. There are 75 total ingredients, including vitamins and minerals, pre- and probiotics, stress adaptogens, antioxidants, “superfoods and mushrooms,” and ingredients for digestion support.</p><p>I noticed smoother digestion, higher baseline energy levels, and healthier skin. One thing I’ll note is that AG1 is quite expensive—$99 for a monthly supply. That’s a whole lot of money for something that could arguably be replaced by a healthy diet. Another thing to note is that AG1 is NSF certified, meaning it’s been tested by an independent third party that certifies the ingredients listed are exactly what’s in the product. I think it’s overpriced, point blank period. But if you feel inclined to spend $100 a month on a thing that may or may not benefit you, it’s a fine option.</p><p>Primal Harvest Super Greens taste like basically nothing after trying all of the others in this guide. There’s a vague hint of cinnamon, or floral tea notes, or a bit of vanilla, but overall this has a clean, inoffensive flavor. Chugging a glass of it felt like chugging a gritty glass of water. It didn’t dissolve quite so readily as some of the other powders I tried, but if you treat greens like another vitamin or supplement in your routine, this product was quite agreeable in terms of texture and flavor. It helped with my digestion but I did feel a bit bloated after drinking it.</p><p>Each serving contains 35 calories; 1 gram of protein; 6 grams of carbohydrates; several vitamins (including vitamins C, E, B12); zinc; a “superfood, antioxidant, and mushroom blend”; a probiotic; and more. Note that it isn’t a notable source of fiber, so make sure you’re getting that elsewhere in your diet.</p><p>Organifi’s Green Juice is widely available in the original mint flavor (though if you shop through its website, there’s an apple flavor as well). Most of the greens in this guide are best served cold, and I’d say that’s doubly true for Organifi. The mint flavor was a bit jarring at first. It tastes like minty spearmint gum, and it was a bit strange to be drinking a mint-flavored beverage. Once I convinced my brain that everything was OK, the rest of the drink went down smoothly, with minimal grit. I liked the apple flavor more, which was a bit like “generic fruit” with notes of banana and citrus. Both flavors were sweet without being too sweet.</p><p>My one complaint about Organifi is that I found the pouches really difficult to close. If you decant the powder into a jar it’ll be fine, but I ended up storing mine upright in a gallon-size ziplock to avoid accidental spills.</p><p>Each serving contains 31 calories, 1 gram of fiber, 7 grams of carbohydrates, and 1 gram of protein. This powder smoothed out my digestion and made me feel less bloated.</p><p>This powder looks kind of gross. I said it! It’s a sort of brownish color with little specks of orange, and I was intimidated when I opened the canister. Unlike most other powders, which advise at least 8 ounces of water per serving, Nourish Multi + Greens requires a minimum of 12 ounces per serving. It tastes bitter, fermented, fizzy, and sweet all at once. It reminded me ofAirborne supplements. While the taste is a bit much, it also does a really good job at masking the savory notes that I find so off-putting in other greens powders. It’s a good balance between “healthy-tasting” and “tasty.” Also unlike other greens powders, this one contains a multivitamin blend as well as traditional greens ingredients—so upon close examination of the ingredients list, you may be able to eliminate some of the vitamins you’re taking.</p><p>Each serving contains 30 calories, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of protein, and 1 gram of fiber. Additional vitamins include A, C, D, E, B6, B12, plus thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, biotin, iron, iodine, copper, potassium, and more Some of the buzzy ingredients in addition to greens include a mushroom blend (with reishi, king trumpet, shiitake, lion’s mane, and turkey tail), a fruit blend, ashwagandha, probiotics, and something called AstaReal Astaxanthin (which the company says supports eye health and antiaging). All I know is that it made me feel like I could conquer the world, and by “the world” I mean “my healthy eating goals for the rest of the day.”</p><p>This greens powder is very subtle. It’s almost unflavored, both the plain version and the Wild Berry version. The instructions aren’t super clear—the packaging says to add a scoop to juice, water, or milk. I mixed mine with 10 ounces of water and it was fine. It didn’t taste great and it didn’t taste bad. It’s vaguely earthy, a little sweet, but mostly neutral. Because of that, I think this is the best candidate for mixing into other drinks. You’ll get a kick of “healthy” flavor without risking overpowering whatever it is you’re drinking.</p><p>Each serving contains 25 calories, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of protein, 3 grams of dietary fiber, a bunch of vitamins (including K, A, B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, and B5), folate, calcium, iron, magnesium, iodine … the list goes on. The brand lists each ingredient and the reasons for inclusion on the website, a deep dive that I appreciate (though again, these are not regulated by the FDA). You’ll get probiotics. You’ll get enzymes. You’ll get the superest of superfoods. I noticed higher energy levels and a healthier-feeling gut. If you already have a morning smoothie routine going, or you want something that tastes healthy without tasting like straight-up grass, I think adding in this powder makes sense.</p><p>A longtime staple at my exurban Costco, a bag of Zena Greens comes with 30 (or 45 at the big-box store) portable 0.4-ounce stick packets of powder. “I put it in smoothies!” the sample vendor told me the last time I walked by, which is really more of a warning than a suggestion, as I can confirm after drinking it for nearly four months that the texture is slightly gritty, with a taste and appearance strongly reminiscent of algae. (One Amazon reviewer described it as “‘I'm drinking a salad’ flavor.”)</p><p>This is to be expected, as organic spirulina powder is number five on the extensive list of ingredients, which also includes 5 grams of fiber—more than any of the powders we tested—plus 1 mg of iron, 29 mg of calcium, and 2 grams of protein. The flavor (I’ve only tried Mixed Berry) does little to mitigate the taste and texture, so this isn't exactly a “beginner” option for those trying powdered greens for the first time. However, it is a worthwhile step up from a more palatable powder like Bloom, as it has 70+ superfoods and probiotics in addition to the decent serving of fiber—many days I’ve gotten away with one packet as a breakfast.—Kat Merck</p><p>Powdered supplements can take a while to dissolve, but a shaker bottle helps speed things along. I’ve tried many different bottles from BlenderBottle, and while they’re all great, the dishwasher-safe Strada Tritan is my favorite. It’s available in many different color combinations—if you buy on BlenderBottle's website, you can choose the bottle color and the ball color—and it has handy measurement lines on the sides. The flip cap is easy to drink from, and it locks as well for extra leak protection. Press the button to flip the lid and take a sip, then close the lid and slide the switch to lock it. Easy-peasy.</p><p>The bottle doesn’t absorb any odors, even if you accidentally leave it in your gym bag for an undisclosed period of time, and the whisking balls (both the plastic Color model and the traditional Wire model) dissolve powder superfast. The inner seal even has a little tab so you can pull it out and clean it separately. I’ve used this cup for greens, creatine, and protein powders, and it always mixes up my drinks in just a few seconds of shaking.</p><p>Huel Daily Greens for $50:Huel’s greens powders come in a big bag with a scoop, and an optional shaker bottle that isincluded for freeif you purchase from the Huel website for the first time. The normal flavor is horrifyingly bad. I am not a person who gags easily, ever, and I thought I was going to actually hurl as I walked around my kitchen gagging after trying it. It is oddly reminiscent of banana, but specifically the white stringy parts of a banana, mixed with the way dog food smells. It’s bitter, savory, and vaguely sweet at the same time. I could only sip it a few times to get those tasting notes down before I dumped it down the drain. The Watermelon flavor is, somehow, even worse. Like if you drank whole milk mixed with a watermelon seltzer water and added in a dash of white button mushrooms. I won’t tell you what’s in this powder because I can’t in good conscience recommend it to you. Even if you hate the taste of Brussels sprouts, I promise they’re still preferable to this supplement. And! To add insult to injury, this vile powder made me gassy, which I am unfortunately admitting to you here on the internet in the hope that it further persuades you to try something else.</p><p>10% Off Wayfair Promo Code with sign-up</p><p>20% off Dyson Promo Code</p><p>$50 Off In-Person Tax Prep When You Switch From Your Tax Current Provider</p><p>Up to $500 off cameras at Canon</p><p>Save extra 10% Off TurboTax</p><p>Exclusive: Up To 50% Off 6 Boxes With Factor Promo Code</p>

        <p>I’m crouching ina seedy alleyway off Trafalgar Square, London, with my MacBook teetering on one knee. The heady reek of piss fills my nostrils. I’m hurriedly punching emoji into a dialog box in my web browser, which is prompting me for the answer to a puzzle. It’s day nine of Crypto: The Game.</p><p>CTG is an elimination game that takes place over 10 days, almost exclusively online. It’s a sort of mutant conglomeration of ideas fromSurvivor,Squid Game,The Hunger Games, andThe Traitors, except everything is crypto-inflected in some way. Each of the 716 players that signed up for the third season, myself included, purchased an entryNFTfor $200 in cryptocurrency. The last player standing would win the $140,000 pot.</p><p>I had raced to Trafalgar Square on that Tuesday afternoon—barreling through tourists like a shoplifter fleeing the law—following clues that promised a route back into the game. I had been voted out by my fellow players the previous night, but if I could solve the puzzle quickly, I might be “resurrected” and have another shot at victory.</p><p>A group of allied players and I had decoded an alphanumeric cipher to arrive at a second peculiar code. When I entered it into ChatGPT, it led to a text file that read, “Congratulations on decoding the clue! The treasure is hidden at coordinates 51.5074° N, 0.1278° W.” I was only five minutes away.</p><p>But when I arrived, panting, it was clear I had it wrong. ChatGPT had apparently hallucinated the coordinates. By the time the real answer—the string of emoji—was circulating in the chat, other players had beaten me to it. My game had come to an end.</p><p>The first twoeditions of Crypto: The Game, which took place in February and April 2024, were an instant hit among crypto fans starved of ways to have fun with crypto beyond trading it.</p><p>Developers havelong struggledto blend crypto functionality into games and services that people want to use because they’re enticing, not just for the opportunity to turn a quick profit. But CTG playerswaxed lyricalabout the game, which became the talk of Crypto Twitter during the first two seasons.</p><p>“Financial incentives are the greatest [user] acquisition tool in the world, but very bad for retention,” says David Phelps, founder of crypto startup JokeRace, who played in the second season of CTG. “Tapping into social incentives is almost radical in crypto.”</p><p>CTG is partly a game of skill; each day, tribes of players compete in a challenge—typically some sort of crypto puzzle, scavenger hunt, or arcade game—with the goal of earning temporary immunity from elimination. But it’s predominantly a social game; one of politicking, alliance-building, maneuvering, and backstabbing. Each night, the tribes without immunity are tasked with voting out a varying number of their own players until only a handful remain. On the final day, a single winner is crowned by the eliminated players.</p><p>“You can’t just backstab your way to the top,” Dylan Abruscato, the creator of CTG, told WIRED in an interview last spring. “You need to play a ruthless but respected game.”</p><p>Nearly a decade ago, Abruscato was an executive at HQ Trivia, a live quizzing game that became a viral hit before the operationran out of cash. CTG is a spiritual successor of sorts, pitched at a narrower audience: chronically online crypto fanatics.</p><p>After the debut season, each subsequent edition has had its own twist. In season two, all players were anonymous, and entry NFTs could be traded on the secondary market. This time, players had to register with an X account but were given a small chance to earn their way back into the game by way of resurrection. “Every season is its own unique social experiment,” says Abruscato. “I always want to keep players on their toes.”</p><p>When I spoke to Abruscato again ahead of the third season, he was careful not to say anything that might give me an undue advantage. But we did discuss the possibility that high-profile players might be targeted for elimination. I’m far from a household name, but given the animus toward journalists in some quarters of cryptoland, I decided to go undercover.</p><p>In my two-and-a-half years covering crypto, I have reported on all manner of frauds, bankruptcies, scams, and other morally dubious shenanigans. The common thread has been the extraction of wealth, which generally flows into the pockets of an already-wealthy or nefarious few at the expense of those who can least afford to lose.</p><p>But CTG struck me as different. It was an opportunity to embed among technologists convinced of the latent potential of crypto technologies, in an experiment that is far less about profit—despite players competing to win a pot of money—than about expressing crypto’s hacker culture and colorful lore.</p><p>I asked a random name generator to assign me an alter ego: Leo Westley. It had a ring to it. Then I created new Google and X accounts and picked up a burner SIM, knowing that players would be communicating over Telegram and working in shared spreadsheets, which they use to coordinate voting.</p><p>As Leo’s profile image, I chose a picture of a floppy-eared spaniel that I sometimes look after. What could be more disarming?</p><p>Players were assigned to different “tribes” in the game to compete together and eliminate each other.</p><p>Before the gamebegan, I listened back to my conversations with CTG players from previous seasons, hoping to glean some essential wisdom that might help me to survive at least a couple of nights.</p><p>Their advice was generally to fly low; not to do anything that would mark me out as either particularly competent or overly hapless. Leaders are quickly eliminated, as are deadweights.</p><p>“To some degree, almost being invisible was a super strength,” said Phelps. “You don’t want to be absent, because you’ll get killed for not contributing. And you don’t really want to stick your head up. Then people think you might be a risk to them.”</p><p>Katy Jeremko, founder of developer cooperative Indie and another former player, had given me an equally precious piece of advice: “Your vote is your most valuable currency.”</p><p>With those warnings ringing in my ears, I entered the game on March 10 and was placed into the Gold Tribe along with around 70 other players.</p><p>Immediately, people fell into archetypal character roles: there were leaders, organizers, data nerds, hype artists, and wallflowers. One person set up a Telegram group and began to ferret away in a spreadsheet. Another “vibe-coded” a program that scraped blockchain data to track who remained in the game. Others shitposted in the chat. Paralyzed by fear of saying the wrong thing, I said very little more than hello.</p><p>Privately, I created my own spreadsheet to make notes on my tribe members, recording their every minor infraction. “Kinda annoying,” I scribbled next to one guy’s handle. “Muppet, get rid,” I wrote next to another. I had met them barely hours earlier.</p><p>Initially, I floated through the nightly eliminations by being performatively present. I contributed to the challenges, updated the spreadsheets when required, and posted in the chat at intervals. The tribe adopted “Gold morning” as a greeting, so I started saying it too.</p><p>Things came to a head on day three. To earn immunity, we had been tasked with achieving the highest possible pinball score. After somebody found a way to cheese the game by rhythmically tapping the up key, it became a challenge of endurance rather than skill. I spent hours improving my score—far longer than my manager would care to know. One player said they felt like they were in an episode ofSeverance: “I heard if we hit 10M points we get a waffle party,” they quipped.</p><p>Afterward, my tribe having been comfortably outscored, the talk turned to the impending vote. The simplest option was to eliminate the lowest scorers. But one player, Luke Cannon, proposed the tribe abstain from voting entirely. It was a high-risk, high-reward strategy: In theory, everyone could be spared, but a single vote in the final minutes of the voting period, which lasted an hour, would be enough to eliminate an undeserving player.</p><p>The vote began at 8 pm ET, midnight for me. The abstinence strategy lasted all of four minutes before someone received a vote. As panic spread, more votes piled in. Players began to point fingers at one another: It was you, wasn’t it?</p><p>“I am declaring martial law in Gold,” wrote Cannon, who had himself received a stray vote. “If you do not dm to contribute your vote you are at risk,” he added, appending a passive-aggressive smiley.</p><p>My heart began to throb a few beats faster. I was reluctant to side with the renegade, but if I was going to be eliminated, I didn’t want to go down twiddling my thumbs. I messaged Cannon privately and voted at his instruction.</p><p>Though Cannon’s intervention saved a few worthy players, replacing them on the elimination board with nonparticipants and low pinball scorers, he was unable to save himself. The display of pacifism and tribe unity had descended into a bloodbath. But I had survived.</p><p>The following day,the gamemasters had prepared a surprise: Everyone would be changing tribes. I was swapped into Silver, bidding farewell to almost all of my old team members. Strangely, though really they were only strangers, I missed them.</p><p>I was greeted by another set of self-elected leaders who were busy deploying a labyrinth of spreadsheets and Telegram chats, which this time could only be accessed with a Silver Tribe NFT. The idea was to prevent any infiltrators from sowing disorder—sabotage is not uncommon in CTG—but the more convoluted system bewildered some players.</p><p>It seemed a fitting allegory for the very crypto tendency to overcomplicate, where a manual process would do. “The most crypto experience ever,” remarked one player. “It’s 2025 we gotta do better 😂.”</p><p>Meanwhile, I splintered into a separate chat made up of seven former Gold members that now belonged to Silver, who would become the closest thing I had in the game to a cabal.</p><p>The days began to blend together as I settled into my strange new routine: I woke up late, participated in the challenge, performed any necessary spreadsheet admin, kept abreast of conversation, and shuffled back to my desk for the vote at midnight. My unlucky partner, much-neglected for the duration of the game, was rudely awoken each night as I clambered over her to reach my side of the bed. As I tried to fall asleep, my mind replayed the conversations of the day, as if projected onto the inside of my eyelids.</p><p>Players who failed to spend every waking moment with the tribe were marked out for potential elimination, professional duties and family life be damned. Though my partner gladly had a go at the arcade game challenges, she was otherwise bemused by my new preoccupation with my tribe. One day, I tried to solicit her advice on a point of in-game strategy. “I don’t know how crypto nerds think!” she responded with a laugh, shooing me back to my desk.</p><p>Players would vote for others to be kicked out of the game. Those that received the most votes were eliminated.</p><p>Unlike in myprevious tribe, the Silver leaders attempted to exercise total control over each elimination, assigning specific votes to specific players and even demanding proof of compliance. To help determine who should be voted out, one of them coded up a Telegram bot that required players to “check in” and recorded how frequently they contributed to the chat. Along with each player’s scores in the challenges, this data was fed into the spreadsheet.</p><p>In our splinter group, the former Gold members and I bristled at the idea of voting on rails but caved to the demands. “Tonight, servitude feels like the move? Lol,” wrote Nick Prince, one of my fellow conspirators. He was right.</p><p>On day eight, the game changed again. There would be no challenge, players were told, but all tribes would merge into one. “This is now an individual game,” the CTG website declared.</p><p>With 315 players still in play and only two days left until the finale, there was an undercurrent of tension. On Telegram, players started to talk about the “Red Wedding,” a famously bloody scene inGame of Thrones.</p><p>Before the vote, an anonymous person defaced the spreadsheet shared among all remaining players. “Dear Data Grunts,” the note read. “The data you’re inputting is just busy work. Hope you made friends this season. They’re all that’s going to save you now.”</p><p>An anonymous message written in the communal spreadsheet.</p><p>The strategy among former Silver members was to arrange truces with a handful of other groups, thereby deflecting votes elsewhere. The trouble was knowing whether anyone could be trusted to keep their word. After allowing myself on previous nights to be cowed into voting as somebody else instructed, I resolved to vote as I pleased, come what may.</p><p>That night, 100 players were up for elimination, but potentially more if a large number of people received the same amount of votes. The statistical probability meant that a single vote would likely be fatal.</p><p>For the first few minutes, I watched the votes peel in. Then my gut flipped; my icon had flashed up onscreen, framed in red. I understood that my game had probably come to an end—and I would probably never find out who was responsible.</p><p>I spent my own bullet on a player who, at least in my estimation, had behaved condescendingly in the chat. They and 157 other players went out with me.</p><p>The elimination message displayed to players who were kicked off the game.</p><p>On the finalday, 68 players remained. Instead of voting against one another, they now had to pitch for the votes of everyone who had previously been eliminated. The individual with the greatest amount of support would win the $140,000 prize.</p><p>A few of the finalists appeared on the CTG companion podcast that aired nightly during the CTG season, to plead their case. Many said they would split the pot, either with people who voted for them, their tribe members, charitable organizations, or along some other lines. Others said they would spend the winnings on their children or use it to pay down medical debt. “I beg for your votes. This is life-changing money for my family,” said one player.</p><p>At the end of the first season of CTG, ananonymous player from Japanwas crowned victor after wooing their peers with abstract poetry. The prize fund in the second season was claimed by a player whopromisedto commit the winnings to the legal defense of two developers behind crypto serviceTornado Cash, who had beencharged with money laundering.</p><p>This time, it came down to a single vote. Two front-runners leapfrogged one another on the leaderboard throughout the day. The prize was ultimately claimed byTed, a player from California who had come in second place the previous season, whopitched voterson her redemption arc: Ted had been eliminated on the eighth night, like myself, but was given an NFT to participate in the final by a close ally, who believed that she had a better chance to win.</p><p>“I still can’t believe it’s real. I feel manic,” said Ted, appearing on the CTG companion podcast after the vote. “I’m still speechless.”</p><p>After I left the game, the immediate feeling was a sinking disappointment; though I never imagined I might win, I had invested a piece of myself in the competition. But that sensation was quickly swallowed by relief.</p><p>At the end of nine consecutive days spent consorting with strangers on the internet, I was emotionally and physically exhausted. The game demands constant outward performance and careful introspection from players, and even a brief lapse could result in their eviction. My exit felt like emerging from a fugue.</p><p>I was reminded of something another player had said after they were eliminated from the game. “Off to touch some grass,” they told the tribe, signing off on Telegram. I decided I would do the same.</p>

    <h1>The Best Programming Language for the End of the World</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Once I startedthinking about the apocalypse, it was hard to stop. An unsettling encounter with thedoomsday clockthat hangs over New York City’s Union Square got me frantically searching WikiHow for survival tips. I soon found my way to the doomsday writings of a Canadian programmer named Virgil Dupras. He believes the collapse of civilization is imminent and that it will come in two waves.</p><p>First, global supply chains will crumble. Modern technology relies on a delicate web of factories and international shipping routes that are exquisitely vulnerable to rapid climate change. The iPhone uses memory chips from South Korea, semiconductors fromTaiwan, and assembly lines in Brazil and China. The severing of these links will, Dupras says, catalyze total societal breakdown.</p><p>The second part will happen when the last computer crashes. The complexity of modern hardware means it’s nearly impossible to repair or repurpose, and without the means to make new devices, Dupras believes there will be a slow blackout—less bang, more whimper. Routers die. Servers take their last breath. Phones crap out. Nothing works.</p><p>Except Collapse OS. Lightweight and designed to run on scavenged hardware, it’s Dupras’operating systemfor the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>Dupras lives in the countryside of Quebec, Canada, with his wife and two kids, in a 500-person town where people chop their own wood, grow their own food, and sometimes build their own houses. It felt odd sending him a Google Calendar invite—I knew from his trove of essays that he hates big tech. When we spoke, he sounded oddly monotonous. Was it a bad connection? Muffled audio? No. Unlike many of his sustainably minded neighbors, Dupras thinks the battle against climate change is futile. We’ve already lost. “Once you’ve peeped into the abyss, you can’t really unsee it,” he says. Dupras has simply accepted his fate, to the point where it’s become an article of faith. The same way there are Catholics, there are Collapseniks, he says.</p><p>But he’s not hopeless. A hopeless man wouldn’t prep so monomaniacally for the anti-singularity. Dupras started building Collapse OS in 2019 in an attempt to preserve mankind’s ability to program 8-bit microcontrollers. These tiny computers control things like radios and solar panels, and they can be used in everything from weather monitoring to digital storage. Dupras figured that being able to reprogram them with minimal remaining resources would be essential post-collapse. But first he had to teach himself a suitably apocalypse-proofed programming language for the job.</p><p>In the late1950s, the computer scientist Chuck H. Moore was working at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, predicting the future position of celestial bodies and satellites based on observational data. Machine memory was scarce—these were still the days of punch cards—and Moore needed a way to optimize processing efficiency by minimizing memory use. He developed a program that executed simple commands directly, one at a time, without needing to be recompiled. Over the next decade, it grew into a programming language that he called Forth.</p><p>Forth communicates directly with the hardware. It controls a computer’s memory via commands called “Words” that you define on the fly. Because the foundational set of commands sitting under those Words is defined in native machine code, only a small part needs to be translated—meaning a smaller assembler and less RAM. As a result, Forth offers a remarkable amount of what Dupras calls “power density,” making it the perfect foundation for Collapse OS. That matters because the lights (probably) won’t go off forever—instead, our easy world of electricity on tap will be replaced by precious and hard-won local generators. Efficient use of processing power will be pivotal. In a post on Collapse.org, his sprawling manifesto/blog/brain dump/manual, Dupras describes how his discovery of Forth conjured “what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.”</p><p>It took Dupras two years to finish Collapse OS. Booting a copy of it from a USB stick gives tech-savvy users the ability to program microcontrollers, which, in turn, could allow them to automate greenhouses, control phone lines, and even regulate power. But Dupras knew that wouldn’t be enough to rebuild society after the collapse. So in 2022, he began work on Dusk OS—a version of Collapse OS that runs on modern devices. Dupras used Forth to build his own compiler that made Dusk OS compatible with code written in C (the foundation of most modern software). This way, without having to rewrite logic that already exists from scratch, Dusk OS is able to retrieve and edit text and access file formats commonly used to back up devices. It can be emulated to work on smartwatches and old tablets and is designed to be hacked and bootstrapped to its user’s liking.</p><p>At first I couldn’t see why any of this would even matter: Surely computer access won’t be a priority when we’re fighting each other for food? At no point duringThe Last of Usdoes Pedro Pascal pause his flight from the zombies to bang out an email. But Dupras makes agood point: What happensafterwe’ve reacquainted ourselves with hunting and gathering?</p><p>If we want to rebuild society, we’ll need to know how. And in the event of a civilizational collapse, a lot of our collective expertise—like my precious WikiHows—will be locked away on hard drives or lost in the cloud. Dupras hopes that Dusk OS will give post-collapse humans access to archives of lost knowledge, like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault for human endeavor. The catch? It’s best to have Dusk OS downloaded on an old phone, memory stick, or laptop before the collapse. Otherwise, without the internet, you’ll only be able to get it by copying it from someone who already has it installed. Which brings us to the other thing—the reason Dupras equates proficiency in Forth to power. Very few people will havebotha copy of Dusk OSandthe knowledge to operate it. This select group will hold the keys to rebuilding society and will become, in effect, post-collapse philosopher-kings. It was time for me to go Forth and conquer.</p><p>Coding in Forthreminded me of the lawless dystopia inMad Max. You make your own rules, subject to the limits of the context. You can redefine the IF statement if you so please. You can rewrite machine code instructions for a Word. You can even change Words during run time. Because Words become keywords themselves in Forth, you can create a language that’s optimized for a single purpose, packing commands that would otherwise be dozens of lines into just one. “In Forth, you’re creating your own language,” Leo Brodie, author of the first Forth textbook,Starting Forth, told me.</p><p>The low-level nature of Forth, while key to its processing power, made programming feel foreign. It uses postfix, a form of mathematical notation that renders 2 + 1 as 2 1+ and which I found neither intuitive nor even really legible. And while most languages allow memory to be broken up and moved around, Forth is stack-based—meaning data is stored chronologically and managed on a last-in/first-out basis. I kept running into bugs, forcing myself to abandon programming conventions I had considered universal. I found myself struggling to speak the language of the machine.</p><p>When I emailed Dupras to ask for help, he compared using Forth to driving a stick. It’s more granular than C. Where the latter defines calling conventions, variable storage, and return stack management, Forth leaves it all up to the programmer. It directly interacts with memory the same way C does but far outperforms C in precision and efficiency. “People mistake Forth as just a language,” Dupras says. “It’s a way to interact with the computer.”</p><p>The reason Forth isn’t more popular is the same reason most of us drive automatics. The personal computing boom of the 1990s sparked an obsession with making tech fit your palm and making code easier to write. Languages were abstracted to protect programmers from themselves, and somewhere along the way, we got lost. Things became bloated for the sake of convenience and, in Dupras’ words, started “oozing inscrutable pus at every corner.”</p><p>“The way we understand efficiency is so skewed,” Dupras says. Forth is a scythe to Python’s lawnmower. “If you calculate the number of joules per blade of grass, you’ll find that the person scything is more efficient,” he says. “When you think of speed, you’d see the lawnmower as more efficient.” Forth forces you to be precise and memory-efficient—to marshal your resources carefully, as you would after the collapse. Dupras cuts his own lawn with a scythe, obviously. “At a certain point, you can go as fast as a lawnmower,” he says.</p><p>I began to find my way. Rather than sending bytes into the ether and trusting the system to figure out where they go, as I would in Python, I got used to being responsible for allocating and freeing memory. All I could think about was what was being stored, where it was being stored, and how much space it required. Each line of code suddenly bore weight. I was Immortan Joe, my laptop was my Citadel, and memory was my water.</p><p>Soon I found myself refining and revisiting my code like I would a run-on sentence. Instead of expecting the machine to anticipate my needs, I tried to think like the machine, to meet it more than halfway. And because I had to think twice, all the needlessly complicated acronyms that remind us to be concise in other coding languages—YAGNI (you aren’t gonna need it), KISS (keep it simple, stupid), DRY (don’t repeat yourself)—were rendered obsolete.</p><p>After spending days fiddling with Forth, returning to Python felt luxurious. I never had to consider memory scarce, and I never had to thoroughly explain myself. It felt like catching up with an old friend. At that moment, the resources that go into making programming “user-friendly” became painfully apparent.</p><p>Before I metDupras, I thought of efficiency in terms of speed. But the true costs of that speed are carefully hidden in rural data centers and distant copper mines. I rarely considered the energy required to power each additional gigabyte of RAM, or the fact that cloud computing now has a bigger carbon footprint than the airline industry.</p><p>Despite the compounding environmental costs, memory is as cheap and plentiful as it’s ever been. Today, languages that sit closer to the machine are only used out of necessity: banks trying to minimize latency for financial trades, spacecraft working with limited onboard resources, outdated systems that would require too much work to update.</p><p>But during a civilizational collapse, the quiet luxuries of array handling and automated memory management will largely disappear. As convenience whisks us further away from the machine, we risk forgetting how computers actually work and losing the ability to rebuild our tech in the event of a collapse. “No one remembers how to write a text editor,” says Devine, an independent programmer who corresponds with Dupras. “When you start forgetting how to do something as crucial as that, when things start to fall apart, they fall apart hard.”</p><p>Devine views efficiency in programming not as a lawnmower or a scythe but as something more like a wildflower meadow—“the least amount of transformation of state possible.” In their view, AI is the pinnacle of “human-centric” programming, where the computer figures out what you’re trying to do and does it for you. Something clicked for me at that moment. As programmers grow more reliant on high-level languages, the average proficiency of low-level languages plummets, which increases the demand for the computing resources that support that abstraction in the first place. AI won’t just take our jobs, it’ll make us forget how to do them—if we don’t run out of the energy to power it first.</p><p>But maybe there is another way. Since 2016 Devine and their partner Rek have been living full-time on a small boat in the northern Pacific, and they use lower-level languages like Forth to maximize what they can do with the 190 watts of daily power they get from two solar panels. I found them on a mailing list of roughly a hundred Collapseniks. Their lifestyle was like a sneak preview of the resource-constrained life Dupras expects us all to be living soon. When I reached out for a chat in August, they told me they might have cell service in October.</p><p>When we finally connected (audio only), Devine struck me as a younger, more optimistic version of Dupras. While fully sympathetic to Dupras’ vision of collapse, Devine believes in the power of low-level programming not for its ability to rebuild society but for its potential topreventcollapse. Devine has observed a growing trend called “permacomputing” that fosters a more mindful relationship with technology, one that considers resource constraints.</p><p>As I returned from the wilderness—back to the world of luxuries like hash tables and built-in libraries that I’d previously taken for granted—I brought back with me a new awareness of the intricacies of the machine, and maybe even a little hope. Forth is how Dupras prepares for the worst, but it’s also helping people like Devine and Rek code—and live—more sustainably. If we can all do that, perhaps the end of the world isn’t as inevitable as it seems.</p><p>Let us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor atmail@wired.com.</p>

    <h1>The Worm That No Computer Scientist Can Crack</h1>

        <p>The Santa Anawinds were already blowing hard when I ran the first worm simulation. I’m no hacker, but it was easy enough: Open a Terminal shell, paste some commands from GitHub, watch characters cascade down the screen. Just like in the movies. I was scanning the passing code for recognizable words—neuron,synapse—when a friend came to pick me up for dinner. “One sec,” I yelled from my office. “I’m just running a worm on my computer.”</p><p>At the Korean restaurant, the energy was manic; the wind was bending palm trees at the waist and sending shopping carts skating across the parking lot. The atmosphere felt heightened and unreal, like a podcast at double speed.You’re doing, what, a cybercrime?my friend asked. Over the din, I tried to explain:No, not a worm like Stuxnet. A worm like Richard Scarry.</p><p>By the time I got home it was dark, and the first sparks had already landed inAltadena. On my laptop, waiting for me in a volumetric pixel box, was the worm. Pointed at each end, it floated in a mist of particles, eerily stick-straight and motionless. It was, of course, not alive. Still, it looked deader than dead to me. “Bravo,” said Stephen Larson, when I reached him later that night. “You have achieved the ‘hello world’ state of the simulation.”</p><p></p><p>Larson is a cofounder ofOpenWorm, an open source software effort that has been trying, since 2011, to build a computer simulation of a microscopic nematode calledCaenorhabditis elegans. His goal is nothing less than a digital twin of the real worm, accurate down to the molecule. If OpenWorm can manage this, it would be the first virtual animal—and an embodiment of all our knowledge not only aboutC. elegans, which is one of the most-studied animals in science, but about how brains interact with the world to produce behavior: the “holy grail,” as OpenWorm puts it, of systems biology.</p><p>Unfortunately, they haven’t managed it. The simulation on my laptop takes data culled from experiments done with living worms and translates it into a computational framework called c302, which then drives the simulated musculature of aC. elegansworm in a fluid dynamic environment—all in all, a simulation of how a worm squiggles forward in a flat plate of goo. It takes about 10 hours of compute time to generate five seconds of this behavior.</p><p>So much can happen in 10 hours. An ember can travel on the wind, down from the foothills and into the sleeping city. That night, on Larson’s advice, I tweaked the time parameters of the simulation, pushing beyond “hello world” and deeper into the worm’s uncanny valley. The next morning, I woke to an eerie orange haze, and when I pulled open my laptop, bleary-eyed, two things made my heart skip: Los Angeles was on fire. And my worm had moved.</p><p>At this point,you may be asking yourself a very reasonable question. Back at the Korean place, between bites of banchan, my friend had asked it too. The question is this:Uhh … why?Why, in the face of everything our precarious green world endures, of all the problems out there to solve, would anyone spend 13 years trying to code a microscopic worm into existence?</p><p>By way of an answer, I’ll offer one of the physicist Richard Feynman’s most famous dictums:What I cannot create, I do not understand.For much of its history, biology has been a reductionist science, driven by the principle that the best way to understand the mind-boggling complexity of living things is to dissect them into their constituent parts—organs, cells, proteins, molecules. But life isn’t a clockwork; it’s a dynamic system, and unexpected things emerge from the interactions between all those little parts. To truly understand life, you can’t just break it down. You have to be able to put it back together, too.</p><p>TheC. elegansnematode is a tiny worm, barely as long as a hair is wide, with less than a thousand cells in its body. Of those, only 302 are neurons—about as small as a brain can get. “I remember, when my first child was born, how proud I was when they reached the age they could count to 302,” said Netta Cohen, a computational neuroscientist who runs aworm labat the University of Leeds. But there’s no shame in smallness, Cohen emphasized:C. elegansdoes a lot with a little. Unlike its more unpleasant cousins, it’s not a parasite, outsourcing its survival needs to bigger organisms. Instead, it’s what biologists call a “free-living” animal. “It can reproduce, it can eat, it can forage, it can escape,” Cohen said. “It’s born and it develops, and it ages and it dies—all in a millimeter.”</p><p>Worm people like Cohen are quick to tell you that no fewer than four Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work onC. elegans, which was the first animal to have both its genome sequenced and its neurons mapped. But there’s a difference between schematics and an operating manual. “We know the wiring; we don’t know the dynamics,” Cohen said. “You would think that’s an ideal problem for a physicist or a computer scientist or a mathematician to solve.”</p><p>They’ve certainly tried.C. elegans’ first simulator was Sydney Brenner, who elevated the lowly worm from compost pile to scientific superstardom with hislandmark 1986 paper“The Structure of the Nervous System of the NematodeCaenorhabditis elegans,” reverently known in worm circles as “The Mind of a Worm.” In a lab in Cambridge, England, Brenner’s team spent 13 years painstakingly slicing worms and photographing them through an electron microscope, relying on a first-generation minicomputer—the kind programmed with punched-paper tape—to reconstitute their data into a rudimentary map of the worm’s nervous system.</p><p>Every 10 or 20 years since, computer scientists have attempted to expand on Brenner’s work. But biology tends to quickly humble the computer people. In 2003, the computer scientist David Harel pronounced the simulation ofC. elegansa “grand challenge” for biology, a field that he considered overdue for an “extremely significant transition from analysis to synthesis.” Although Harel was surely right about that, he never managed to model more than the worm’s vulva—true story.</p><p>For her part, Cohen has spent the better part of 20 years publishing breakthrough computational models that account for the sinusoidal squirm ofC. elegansas it inches forward through different viscosities. But how the worm moves backward is an entirely different, unsolved problem—and don’t even ask about how a worm moves up and down, or, for that matter, why. All of the data we have aboutC. elegansbehavior comes from worms in flat agar plates. For all we know, they might do things completely differently in the wild. “Why not?” Cohen said with a laugh. “It’s biology.”</p><p>When OpenWorm announcedits intentions in 2011, Stephen Larson, an engineer who had “found religion” in open source, believed that if he could just convene a group of dedicated computational researchers to take a crack at biology, they might make meaningful progress on a simulation. Thirteen years later, he’s more contrite. “The project might be a cathedral,” Larson told me. “If I don’t have the ability to finish it, then at least other people can see it and build on it.”</p><p>This could be burnout talking; spearheading an open source project on a shoestring, for any amount of time, can sap even the most dedicated idealist. It could be the deceptive complexity ofC. elegans’ brain, which continues to defy easy capture. It could also just be bad timing.</p><p>OpenWorm doesn’t do its own research. Instead, the project’s cohort of volunteers culls from theC. elegansliterature, integrating into their simulation whatever data they can find. This means they’re reliant on worm labs like Cohen’s, which have been slow to produce the kind of inputs that are really useful for a computational effort. But over the past decade or so, experimentalists have powered up microscopes and refined genetic techniques, producing more and better recordings of the worm’s brain as it goes about its business. At the same time, machine-learning tools have emerged to make sense of all that data, and computational power is through the roof. The convergence makes Larson hopeful. “When you’re in a time of almost exponential technological expansion, something that sounds crazy is maybe doable,” he said.</p><p>I asked Cohen, who serves on OpenWorm’s scientific advisory panel, if it is, in fact, doable. “Well, let’s start from the premise that it is,” she said. “What do we need to do?” Cohen is one of 37 coauthors on arecent opinion paperoutlining a new plan: Use genetic imaging technology to activate each neuron in the worm’s nervous system one by one, measuring its effect on the other 301. Repeated hundreds of thousands of times in parallel experiments, this methodical process should hoover up enough data to give the computational folks, finally, something to work with—enough, even, to “reverse engineer” the worm completely.</p><p>It’s an ambitious proposal, one that will require an unprecedented level of collaboration between some 20 different worm labs. Gal Haspel, a computational neuroscientist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the lead author on the reverse engineering paper, estimates that pulling it off may take up to 10 years, cost tens of millions of dollars, and require something in the neighborhood of 100,000 to 200,000 real-life worms. In the process, it will generate more data aboutC. elegansthan has been collected in all of science to date. And what, in the end, will the reverse engineers have to show for it? “All these people and all these computers,” Haspel said. “And we’ll end up doing what one little animal can do right now.”</p><p>He’s being wry. Haspel also compared the project to a NASA moonshot: It’s the kind of undertaking that drives technology forward, pushing engineers to build better tools and scientists to work together. The worm simulation is an opportunity, Haspel believes, for a new kind of science, one driven by automation, big data, and machine learning. And although the end product is only a worm, and an expensive, inefficient one at that—in a sense the world’s most sophisticated Tamagotchi—it can be a stepping stone toward understanding more complex nervous systems and eventually, someday, the human mind.</p><p>Last summer, acrypto developer posted an animated GIF on X of a virtualC. elegansworm bonking around an onscreen window. The animation was generated using the same code I ran on my own laptop, which is freely available on OpenWorm’s GitHub. “If the worm matrix runs on my M1 Mac,”he pronounced, “what are the chances we are actually in base reality?” Maybewe’rethe worms, he meant—and, on a cosmic MacBook on some higher plane of reality, someone’s running us. The post went viral; Elon Musk, of course, liked it.</p><p>When I mentioned the worm matrix to OpenWorm’s project director, Padraig Gleeson, a computational neuroscientist at University College London, he visibly winced. “Some people come to this because they want philosophical discussions about this type of thing. That’s fine,” he said. “My priority is that it’d be very nice to actually look at the biology.”</p><p>Gleeson is the Woz to Larson’s Jobs—he’s less interested in building the Überworm than he is in a platform that bundles smaller, more granular models ofC. elegans’ biological machinery. Computational modeling is common practice in biology; it’s an inexpensive way to encode and test theories as “thought experiments” before breaking out the agar plates and worm food. Usually, biological models concern some small aspect of the organism being studied—the handful of neurons, say, driving forward locomotion. When it comes to modeling, “we don’t want the map to be as good as the territory. That would defeat the purpose,” explained Eduardo Izquierdo, a computational neuroscientist at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who focuses on worm modeling. “We’re looking for something to help us think through things.”</p><p>Nobody would confuse a biological model with the real thing. But a full-on simulation opens a very different can of worms. To borrow Izquierdo’s reference, itisa map as good as the territory—and as such, it invites new speculation about the nature of that territory, to say nothing of life itself. If a model helps scientists answer questions, a simulation raises them. Like, what separates a virtual worm from its living kin, if the two are identical down to the molecule?</p><p>The way Larson sees it, a fully faithful worm simulation will be a category-expanding event: Rather than invalidating our current understanding of life, it might broaden it. “If we want to say that aliveness can only be satisfied by systems of physical molecules that physically exist with mass in the planet, something in a computer that doesn’t have physical molecules cannot be alive,” he said. “But if we expand our definition of aliveness to instead be more about information, then perhaps there is a version of aliveness that you could apply to a simulated animal. And then the question is, does it matter?”</p><p>I think itmatters. Life is information, but it’s something more, too—something we feel most strongly when it’s gone. I wonder if, in this light, Feynman’s dictum shouldn’t be amended. It’s not that creation breeds understanding, exactly. It’s that only by attempting to re-create life can we come to understand how irreplaceable it is.</p><p>Of course, I say this because I’m surrounded by destruction. The air is toxic now, and flakes of white ash have eddied into every crevice of the house. At the edge of the evacuation zone, close enough to smell the smoke, I’m keeping myself distracted by cooking up more and moreC. elegansproto-simulations. Watching them, I can’t help but marvel at how easy it is to destroy life, and how difficult it is to create it. All it takes is a single spark to torch centuries of growth overnight—but to prompt one sluggish inch forward from a virtual worm? That’s the work of decades, and it may never be finished.</p><p>Let us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor atmail@wired.com.</p>

Amazon’s Eero makes some ofour favorite mesh systems, ideal for busy families seeking a set-and-forget mesh. The Pro 6E is a tri-band system with a 6-GHz band for fast Wi-Fi at close range, and with the jump to Wi-Fi 7 systems still costly, this system is worth considering right now. But you need an Eero Plus subscription at $10 per month or $100 per year to unlock the best features, including parental controls, advanced security, and ad blocking. There are discounts on other Eero systems, so check ourEero buying guideto decide which is best for your home.—Simon Hill</p><p>DJI’s debut portable power station can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and boasts DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can juice up phones, run microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast charge most models. It gets a little noisy with several gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in ourbest portable power stationsguide.—Simon Hill</p><p>Built to last, this braided nylon cable’s exterior is 100 percent recycled plastic that Anker promises will last a century. It can operate in temperatures from -40 degrees to 176 degrees Fahrenheit. The ribbed cuffs make it easy to grip for plugging and unplugging, it has USB-IF certification, and it comes with a lifetime warranty. One of thebest USB-C cablesfor charging a wide range of gadgets, the Anker Prime can supply up to 240 watts, making it suitable for laptops, smartphones, and anything else with a USB-C port.—Simon Hill</p><p>This is our favorite budget option in ourguide to Best Webcams. Unlike the original version, it doesn’t come with an integrated right light but its software makes up for it with great automatic white balance and color saturation. It shoots 1080p resolution video at 30 frames per second or 720p resolution at 60 frames per second. Meanwhile the field of vision is a slightly wide 82 degrees. The built-in mics aren’t the best though, so we suggest sticking to the ones on your laptop or snag a USB microphone. You can also tinker with the video settings via theRazer Synapse app.—Brenda Stolyar</p><p>This Qi2 power bank can wirelessly charge at up to 15 watts, but there’s also a built-in USB-C cable that can deliver up to 30 watts, and it supports several charging protocols (PD 3.0, PPS, and QC 3.0). There’s a wee kickstand to prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation forApple's StandByfeature. It’s fairly slim and compact and will boost the battery inside most iPhones, or Qi2 Android phones, by around 50 to 80 percent. —Simon Hill</p><p>Ugreen's charger can supply up to 145 watts (one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W), which very few power banks can do. The ample 25,000 mAh battery will keep all your gadgets topped up and is safe to fly with in yourcarry-on. It’s a solid option for fast-charging phones, tablets, or even laptops (although it doesn't support Samsung's fast-charging tech). A small LED shows the current charge state of the battery, and it comes with a USB-C cable. —Simon Hill</p><p>A classic among podcasters and gamers, the Blue Yeti isa great-sounding microphonethat suits virtually every need you’ll have. A steep discount makes this a must-buy for anyone who is mic shopping this spring, given that these usually retail for well over $100. I like that these have physical controls on the microphone, which makes it easy to mute and adjust volume on the fly.—Parker Hall</p><p>I hate using clip-onreading lightsbecause I always feel like they’re too top-heavy. So, I was excited to find this one that wraps around your neck. It’s lightweight and comfortable to wear for long reading sessions—once you get past how funny it looks. It also offers three color temperature modes including yellow, warm white, and cool. You’ll also have six brightness settings to pick from that you can cycle through with a button. It offers up to 80 hours of battery life at dimmer settings too.—Brenda Stolyar</p><p>I’m not entirely sold on the necessity of XR (mixed reality) or augmented reality glasses. But Viture has done the best job of finding a legitimate use for them: a portable gaming display you can take anywhere. The original Viture One XR Glasses (6/10, WIRED Review) were okay, but the Viture Pro boasts a slightly larger virtual screen (135 inches), a smoother120-Hz frame rate, and a far higher maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. Virtue has also done a nice job with the software, and the experience is tailored for gamers, though various accessories may be required, depending on your platform of choice. You can also use these glasses for multitasking work or watching movies, though the Harman-tuned speakers are limited.—Simon Hill</p><p>Jump to a Topic:Best Tech Deals,Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Home Office Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Beauty Deals,Best Mobile Phone Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers),Best TV Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Pet Deals,Best Outdoor Deals</p><p>When Amazonupdated its entire Kindle lineup, that did not exclude the Kindle versions for kids. My kids have tested the Kindle kids’ versions since they came out in 2019, and to my eye, the new Kindle Kids and Kindle Kids Paperwhite are both noticeably faster and clearer than the old versions. If you’re spending all your money buying comic books, I suggest the Kindle Kids Paperwhite, which is bigger and better for reading graphic novels. It’s also waterproof and, like all Amazon kid devices, comes with a two-year worry-free warranty.—Adrienne So</p><p>This is thebest Kindle(8/10, WIRED Review) for note-taking and reading. It comes with a 10.2-inch (300 ppi) paperlike display, white borders that mimic writing on a traditional piece of paper, and aPremium Penthat has a soft-tipped eraser similar to that of a No. 2 pencil. It also packs features like Active Canvas (where you can write directly within the book you’re reading), expandable margins, and a couple of artificial intelligence tools including Refined Writing (that transforms your notes into a script font) and Summarization (which summarizes your notes).—Brenda Stolyar</p><p>This isthe best Amazon tablet for younger children. It has all the same features as Amazon’s standard Fire tablets, but you’ll also get a rugged case and a two-year replacement guarantee. It also comes with a free year of Amazon Kids+, which gives you access to kid-friendly movies, books, apps, and games. You can manage theparental controlson the device as well. —Scott Gilbertson</p><p>The main difference between the Fire HD Kids and Fire HD Kids Pro tablets is the protective case. The Pro version has a less protective case and is aimed at older kids less likely to drop it. The Pro version still has the same two-year warranty though, so if it does hit the floor, you’re covered.—Scott Gilbertson</p><p>TheFire HD 10 Pro Kid’s Editionis the same as the normal Fire HD 10, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a no-questions-asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon’s tablets are limited but offer some control over content (seeour guidefor more details). —Scott Gilbertson</p><p>Jump to a Topic:Best Tech Deals,Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Home Office Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Beauty Deals,Best Mobile Phone Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers),Best TV Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Pet Deals,Best Outdoor Deals</p><p>This cute little smart plug works withevery smart home speakeryou could hope for, letting you invest without worrying that it won’t work for whichever voice assistant you might fancy in the future. It’s my favorite smart plug for Apple HomeKit users, though it’ll work well for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant users, too. It’s got a nice small form factor so you won’t block the other outlet, and this four-pack makes it easy to transform an entire room (or a small apartment) into a full smart home.—Nena Farrell</p><p>The Roxicosly clock is one of the most reviewednontraditional alarm clockson Amazon. It’s semi-customizable, with the buzzer going up to 106 decibels and a bed shaker that can be used separately or together with the alarm. The vibrations provide a more subtle way to wake up by forgoing the jarring alarm sounds, and the escalating pattern of the buzzing helps ease the snoozer into wakefulness. The vibrations, along with the noise and adjustable intensity, helped me wake up more easily than other buzzing alarms I’ve tried, and at $18, it’s one of the lowest prices we’ve seen for it this year.—Molly Higgins</p><p>Tushy makes some of thebest budget electric bidets, and the Classic 3.0 is a great choice for any bathroom—renters included—since it’s a small accessory that doesn’t require any additional power and can be added to just about any toilet. For having no electricity added, it’s got impressive water power and a nice range of finishes so you can select the one that best matches your bathroom’s vibe.—Nena Farrell</p><p>This excellent cordless vacuum has fallen to $550 before, but it rarely drops below $600 (and doesn’t go on sale super often). It’s thebest Dysonfor most people, boasting all the features you need (like strong suction, a 60-minute run time, and a few different attachments). It also has a neon green laser that lights up the floor in front of the vacuum head, which can help you spot dust particles that you might’ve missed otherwise.—Louryn Strampe</p><p>The Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one ofour favorite Dyson vacuumsoverall. It’s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn’t arobot, this is a great deal on Dyson’s offering.—Louryn Strampe</p><p>True Classic’s white tee is snug in the right places, and relaxed everywhere else.Editor Jeremy White appreciatesthe “dad bod” fit and says the neckline is just right. WIRED UK managing editor Mike Dent admits he’d probably wear it to death as pajamas. It is a 60/40 cotton-poly bend, meaning it’s not the most sustainable choice and is more likely to pill. Still, at $25, it’s a solid tee that won’t make you look like an extra in an early aughts music video.—Boutayna Chokrane</p><p>Dyson loves to make beautiful, techy-looking, almost self-consciously expensive devices. This is why I’d always recommend waiting for a good sale before buying one. Luckily, this is a doozy, knocking $200 off the list price on one of our favorite portable heaters and fans. This model is basically an all-things-to-all people air-changing doohickey par excellence. The HP07 is a space heater with an energy-saving, accurate thermostat that’ll also work as a fan, an air quality monitor, and an air purifying filter. It’s a little loud if you turn the fan up, but among portable space heaters, it’s also the most sophisticated air management systemI’ve tested. —Matthew Korfhage</p><p>We are now approaching thegreat robot vacuum convergence, where all manufacturers agree that somewhere between $500 and $1,000 is the sweet spot for a multifunctional robot vacuum mop. TheEufy X10 Pro Omniwas our top pick in this spot last year, but it got edged out by slightly cheaper models; still, at the sale price, this is still a great robot vacuum whose AI navigation helps it map quickly and efficiently (and provides some comic relief in the process).—Adrienne So</p><p>Yeedi is the affordable sub-brand of Ecovacs, which also makes manyrobot vacuumsthat we like. The company offers a broad array of robot vacuum/mops at a wide range of prices. This one is the midrange model, and I did find that it navigated better than the cheaper versions. There are a few other standout features besides the very good price—the clean/dirty water tanks are absolutely ginormous, so you can go much longer without refilling them, and it has an extendable arm to get in all the little nooks and crannies.—Adrienne So</p><p>Tineco makes some great floor cleaning gadgets—I was vacuuming my entire house with thePure One Station 5before writing this—including a fantastic carpet cleaner. The Tineco Carpet One Pro isour favorite upgrade-worthy carpet cleaner, but it’s on sale right now for nearly half the price, making it the perfect time to snap one up for yourself. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano describes the Carpet One Pro as as much fun as you can hope from a carpet cleaner, with a clever design that leaves the dirty water tank upright while you maneuver the cleaner and a big LED screen to see what mode you’re in. There’s an Auto, Max, and Drying mode, and it can leave white carpet looking like it’s brand-new.—Nena Farrell</p><p>Afina has two main benefits among thenew crop of filtered showerheadsthat promise to filter the chlorine out of the water that reaches your skin and hair. The first is its broad, flat showerhead that offers a lovely, even, spalike spray. The second is that unlike most of the showerheads I tested, Afina works quite well for the entire duration of its filter life. In part, this is because they recommend filter replacement every two months instead of every three months, at $30 a pop. But from our testing, this frequency amounts to a rare honesty. —Matthew Korfhage</p><p>After testingmore than a dozen filtersfrom a new generation of filtered showerhead brands, I can say this handsome little number from Canopy was one of the very few that could bring my total chlorine down to undetectable levels on my chloramine-treated water system. The filter—a mix ofKDF-55, calcium sulfite, and granular activated carbon made from coconut shells—retains about half its efficacy throughout the three-month life of the filter, not a bad record compared to others I’ve tested. What’s more, the thoughtful design offers easy installation, adjustable spray, and even aromatherapy diffusers if that’s your steez. This is almost the lowest price we’ve seen over the past 12 months, and thehandheld version is also on sale.—Matthew Korfhage</p><p>This family favorite frequently comes out when we have people over because it’s so easy to pick up and play, and it’s fun. Each round is based on a single word from a category card determined by a dice roll, but while everyone else knows the word, the chameleon has to bluff their way through. Each player says something associated with the word for that round, and the guesser has to decide who the chameleon is. It’s for up to eight players but is still fun for spectators.—Simon Hill</p><p>If you don’t want to worry about batteries in yoursmart video doorbell, the Reolink Video Doorbell is a great option that lets you wire it into your home, letting it stay powered on for years to come. Reolink has a simple app, an included chime, plus built-in speakers and a microphone. The camera displays 2K video and records to a microSD card, so you don’t need a cloud storage fee like other doorbells.—Nena Farrell</p><p>Thisbody pillowis marketed for pregnant people, but as a non-pregnant person who is an exclusive side sleeper, it worked well for me. The pillow combines popular body- and pregnancy-pillow U and C shapes for a unique shape that provides total-body support no matter which side you sleep on—Momcozy even claims it helps those with pain like sciatica and fibromyalgia. Because of its unique shape that’s got your head and limbs covered, and at less than 40 bucks, this is really the only pillow you’ll need. Insider tip: It comes in multiple cover types, so I’d opt for a lighter cotton fabric cover if you sleep hot.—Molly Higgins</p><p>The Loftie Alarm Clock (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the prettiest bedside gadgets I’ve tried. The sleek alarm clock pairs with an app to let you create your alarms and access a variety of audio content to fall asleep to. There’s even a membership ($6 a month) that gives you access to personalized bedtime stories, meditations, and even your horoscope. There are also plenty of other standard sounds, like white noise and campfires, that you can access without the membership. The Loftie Alarm also has a little nightlight built into it that you can tap on and off, but it is pretty dim so it won’t double as a lamp or bedside light. Overall, it’s a really fun alarm clock, and it pairs with the beautifulLoftie Lamp(sadly not on sale) to become a sunrise alarm setup.—Nena Farrell</p><p>This cute littlesound machinehas a real physical fan inside of it to create the soothing fan noise you can fall asleep to. It only makes the one fan sound, so only get this if you don’t want variety and instead want one good, consistent fan sound. It has a nice fade-in and fade-out feature for timers, too. The only downside is how expensive it is for a single sound, but you can get it cheaper right now.—Nena Farrell</p><p>This ismy favorite wearable breast pumpI’ve ever tried. The Willow Go (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is well priced for a wearable breast pump and works great, and the clear exterior makes it easy to keep an eye on how your pump session is going. It has its own app from Willow, and you can also purchase Willow’s bras that are made to help hold a wearable pump. The pieces are nice and big making it easy to clean without losing something down the drain. It’s a bit of a splurge, though it’s often on sale for $280 (so this is still a better deal than you’d usually find!)—Nena Farrell</p><p>Jump to a Topic:Best Tech Deals,Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Home Office Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Beauty Deals,Best Mobile Phone Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers),Best TV Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Pet Deals,Best Outdoor Deals</p><p>This is our budget recommendation in ourBest Standing Desks guide. The EN1 has a somewhat complicated assembly but once it’s put together, it’s a reliable and affordable standing desk that does the job. You get four memory presets so that the desk can remember your favorite heights, and it can hold up to 154 pounds. —Julian Chokkattu</p><p>I love thistiny table. The frame is designed so that you can roll it under a bed or couch and the desktop will still be easy to access. You can raise it up and down via a lever manually, and the whole thing is on wheels so moving it around is a piece of cake. I’ve been using it for several years as a place for a little photo studio, with clamped-on lights, and it has worked flawlessly. It can hold 15 pounds. —Julian Chokkattu</p><p>Thislittle desk accessorycomes with magnetic clips you can attach to your cables. Those clips can then stay affixed to the magnetic base, which makes this a neat-freak’s solution to organizing those pesky wires. There’s abigger version in caseyou have lots of cables at your desk or nightstand. —Julian Chokkattu</p><p>Jump to a Topic:Best Tech Deals,Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Home Office Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Beauty Deals,Best Mobile Phone Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers),Best TV Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Pet Deals,Best Outdoor Deals</p><p>Any ol’ carbonator can carbonate. But this is a carbonator from Ninja, and so this one can’t merely add bubbles. It must also offer multiple levels of carbonation, and infuse your water with functional B-vitamin flavor pods that taste like dragonfruit or watermelon kiwi and promise to “hydrate” or fill you with energy. Anyway, it’s $50 off for the spring sale. And whilewe did like the SodaStream Enso more, this one costs half as much. —Matthew Korfhage</p><p>WIRED contributing reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro was quite the fan (no pun intended) of this rectangular dehydrator’s fast mode—so much so that she crowned it Best for Those in a Hurry in our guide to theBest Food Dehydrators. It dried apple slices, kiwis, and banana chips in half the time of a typical dehydrator cycle, as viewable through the machine’s large glass window. Lisa was also impressed by its quiet fan and dishwasher-safe stainless steel trays. As the longtime owner of a Nesco dehydrator with infuriatingly difficult-to-clean plastic trays, I can confirm the trays alone make this a worthwhile investment.—Kat Merck</p><p>There’s a lot to like about this excellent-value bread machine, top pick in our guide to theBest Bread Makers. It’s got all the same bells and whistles as higher-end models, including 17 preset programs, a delay timer, and a fruit-and-nut dispenser, and it can turn out loaves in three different sizes, as opposed to the usual one or two. Its ceramic pan is free of nonstick coatings and potential PFOAs and can be run through the dishwasher for easy cleaning. The recipe book leaves something to be desired in terms of variety and readability (and quality of the recipes in general—I recommend looking elsewhere online; some KBS-owning Redditors have had success withKing Arthur recipes). The stirring/kneading cycle is also louder than it needs to be, but otherwise, this is a worry-free choice if you’re in the market for set-it-and-forget it homemade bread.—Kat Merck</p><p>Look, for sheer performance, we mightgo with a KitchenAid.But for value, we already recommend this Aucma even at full price. It goes on sale fairly often, but this is a better deal than most on this 1,400-watt device, which boasts useful little features like a splash guard on its tilt head, and basic functions like six speeds and a pulse function. Attachments include whisk, beater, and dough hook, plus a 6-liter and 5-liter bowl. If you just want a mixer that’ll bother some batter, and you don’t want to spend $200-plus on top-line stand mixers and all their elegant frippery, this is your little lower-priced stand mixer workhorse, briefly priced even lower.—Matthew Korfhage</p><p>The Breville Smart Oven Pro is the workhorse model in Breville’s lineup of Lexus toaster ovens, hanging out at the sweet spot of affordability and execution. It’s oneI’ll recommendto those who want a Breville oven but balk at the price of thetop-pick Joule: It heats evenly, keeps temperature beautifully, and offers a standard array of baking, toasting, broiling, and light convection that nonetheless definitely is not air frying. The slight curve in its geometry means you can fit a 13-inch pizza pan inside, a 5-quart Dutch oven, or a 12-by-12 square pan. Anyway, Breville doles out sales sparingly, and this little corker is $50 off for the spring sale. —Matthew Korfhage</p><p>This littlecountertop pizza ovenmade the rounds on TikTok last year for being so cute, compact, and relatively affordable. Astonishingly, its claims of heating to 800 degrees Fahrenheit on the top and bottom heating element are accurate and it takes about 15 minutes! The top heating element doesn’t cover the whole pizza and it loses heat very quickly, since it opens like a waffle maker. Still, this is a nice housewarming present for a pizza lover. I also use it to heat up tortillas and pitas for dinner.—Adrienne So</p><p>It’s not a secret: AeroPress is thebest and easiest and most lovely coffee maker that can fit in a literal pocket, assuming you’ve got deep pockets. The original version is already the default option for countless hotel room and campsite self-caffeinators. The newer Go travel version is even more lightweight, self-contained, and remains beautifully customizable to your own perfect taste. For now, it’s quite a bit cheaper: more than a third off the list price. —Matthew Korfhage</p><p>This stainless steel beauty goes on sale reasonably often, but this is still a great deal on a handsome stainless steel French press that forgoes both microplastics and frangible glass (whose shards shall henceforth be referred to as micro-glass.) I’ve been hunting down non-plastic alternatives for pretty much everything in my kitchen: With everything made of steel right down to the coffee maker filters, Mueller is a strong entrant on my list, and WIRED’sfavorite pick among stainless steel French press. —Matthew Korfhage</p><p>I found these ramekins to be supremely helpful whiletesting meal kitsfor work. You see TV chefs using tiny ramekins and bowls all the time, and as it turns out, they know what they’re doing. Whipping up a compound butter? Tiny bowls! Zesting a lemon before juicing it? Tiny bowls. Separating the white and green halves of a green onion? Tiny. Bowls. They’re also handy when baking individual desserts, such as the lava cakes my partner became obsessed with last year. Get some tiny bowls! —Louryn Strampe</p><p>The Instant Pot Vortex Plus is thebest air fryerwe’ve tried. This usually sells for between $140 and $90, and we’ve only seen it drop below this price a few times before. It keeps temperature precisely and it manages to crisp up food without stripping away moisture. The basket preheats quickly and the simple display is intuitive. Reviewer Matthew Korfhage also appreciated the fact that the controls don’t beep—the simple dial keeps things quiet.</p><p>Jump to a Topic:Best Tech Deals,Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Home Office Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Beauty Deals,Best Mobile Phone Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers),Best TV Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Pet Deals,Best Outdoor Deals</p><p>This consistently popular hair-straightening comb was not the answer for members of our team withsuper thick and curly hair, but for those whose hair is easy to straighten or simply wavy, it’s definitely worth considering for the price and ease of use. The outer shell that covers the hot teeth is safer than atraditional flat ironand enables users to get closer to their roots than they would otherwise, which is great for tamping down flyaways. The brush is also reasonably lightweight at under 1 pound, in case you’d want to use it for travel. Also note that it comes with a black-and-pink heat-resistant glove, which apparently is to use on your hair and not actually on the tool, as former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found out the hard way.—Kat Merck</p><p>This is the original “upgrade” hair straightener that changed the flat iron game for many (including myself) when it was released in 2006, and it’s still going strong today. Former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber tried it for our guide to theBest Hair Straightenersand says it still lives up to the hype. It only heats to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, but it does so in seconds and requires minimal passes. Woollaston-Webber says the outer plastic does get hot while styling, so it may not be the best pick for younger users, but if that doesn’t bother you this is still the best deal on a solid hair straightener you’ll find for $50.—Kat Merck</p><p>The Aquasonic Black Series is not for the weak-gummed. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found the vibrations a little overwhelming—the whole body buzzes more than the bristles themselves. But if you love that ultra-deep-clean sensation, this is a steal at $30. Plus, you get eight replacement heads, which would cost more than the brush itself with some brands. If you’d prefer agentler toothbrush, you might be better off with aSonicareorBitvae, which are also on sale.—Boutayna Chokrane</p><p>The Tymo Airflow is a great two-in-one tool, letting you both curl and straighten your hair with the same device. I love it for my fine hair, and I think it shines best as a straightener, though it can do some nice soft curls. There’s 3D floating plates, a ceramic finish, and a rounded form factor that makes it look like a curler, but opens up like a straightener. There’s five heat options ranging from 284 to 428 degrees Fahrenheit, and Tymo has a guide on which to choose based on your hair type.—Nena Farrell</p><p>If oscillating toothbrushes feel too intense on your gums, the Philips Sonicare 4100 Electric Toothbrush is a gentler powerhouse. You get a pressure sensor that reduces vibrations when you’re brushing too hard, a two-minute timer, and two intensity settings (low and high). A single charge lasts about two weeks, and it’s designed with BrushSync technology that tracks how long (and hard) you’ve been brushing and will remind you when it’s time to replace the head. Normally $50—now $40—this is the best midrange electric toothbrush we’ve tested.—Boutayna Chokrane</p><p>If you’re still scraping your tongue withyour toothbrush, it’s time for MasterMedi Tongue Scraper. This stainless steel scraper is way more effective, easier to clean, and won’t snap in half like plastic versions. This two-pack comes with individual cases (one for home, one for your travel kit). While it’s technically dishwasher-safe, just rinse it like an adult. At $8, it’s a small price to pay for a fresher mouth.—Boutayna Chokrane</p><p>Manscaped is more famous for its groin-tamingLawn Mowertrimmer, but never-nudes take heart: You can keep it above the neck with a Beard Hedger whose small stainless steel teeth and high RPMs make it great for shorter beards,according to WIRED contributing reviewer Andrew Williams. A small amount of give in the trimmer’s plastic guide means the Hedger offers a quite close shave. While this isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen, 25 percent off is a solid deal on this trimmer. —Matthew Korfhage</p><p>The Fancii Abigail (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favoritelighted makeup mirrorfor traveling. It measures nearly 8 inches across and it’s easy to transport in a backpack or weekender. Unfurl the flat disc to reveal a mirror that can be used compact-style or raised up on a stand and angled all sorts of directions. The ring light around the mirror is bright, but it doesn’t take up too much of the reflective surface, and there are three light temperature settings to choose from. The interface is simple and the mirror stays closed reliably. It also recharges pretty quickly via USB-C, and the battery lasts for about 10 hours on one charge. If you’re frequently applying your makeup on the go, or you’re sick of terrible hotel bathroom lighting ruining your glam, this price is too good to pass up (in my personal and very experienced opinion). —Louryn Strampe</p><p>If TikTok’s raving about it,I’m skeptical, but experts back this trend up.Snail mucinis packed with glycoproteins and hyaluronic acid—but don’t expect overnight miracles. This gooey essence hydrates, soothes, and leaves skin looking plump without feeling greasy. I slather on the Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Percent Power Repairing Essence Serum nightly after cleansing. At $18, it’s a decent time to snag a bottle or stock up, though we’ve seen the price dip lower before.—Boutayna Chokrane</p><p>These cute little stars that wentviral on TikTokare hydrocolloid patches that canhelp heal pimples. The material attracts water, which helps flatten zits and suck out all the gross stuff inside them. It’s weirdly satisfying to use them, and it’s also empowering, transforming a blemish into an accessory. Pimple patches are usually affordable. The reason I personally like and use Starface patches is because they come in a cute storage case with a little mirror, which helps when I feel hormonal acne cropping up while I’m out and about.Refillsare affordable, too. —Louryn Strampe</p><p>Micellar water is a godsend for those people who are sometimes too lazy to fully wash their faces at night. (It’s me, I’m people.) Simply douse a cotton pad with this magical solution and swipe it over your face for easy makeup removal and a cleaner feeling than oil-based makeup wipes can provide. I especially like using this sensitive-skin formula for travel since I don’t have to rinse my face after using it, making it ideal for camping trips or overnight car rides. I first received it in abeauty box, but it’s affordable and easy to find (and I don’t have to pour my fancy cleanser into a TSA-approved bottle, either). —Louryn Strampe</p><p>I admit I had never before seen or heard of Electrolit until a recent family summer vacation in Las Vegas, when my husband, son, and I made the ill-fated decision to walk the entirety of the Strip during a 115-degree-Fahrenheit heat wave. The Pedialyte-looking bottle was an immediate grab from the cooler at Target, and not only tasted like fruit punch, it quite literally saved my life. The powdered packets taste similar, if not a bit stronger, with vivid hues from artificial food coloring. The company has been around for more than 70 years—beforeLiquid IV, before even Pedialyte—so if you’re looking for an electrolyte beverage that both looks and tastes like the ’80s, this is your chance to score a great deal on an eight-pack.—Kat Merck</p><p>This topped our list of theBest Smart Scales. It quickly and accurately assesses not only your weight but your heart rate, fat and muscle measurements, vascular age, and more. The companion smartphone app is also easy to use. The scale can track data for up to eight users, and the AAA batteries last for over a year. If you’re trying to keep an eye on how your body changes over time, this scale is an investment worth considering. —Louryn Strampe</p><p>If you’vebeen eyeing a Theragunbut can’t stomach the price tag,a massage gun under $50is almost unheard of. The LifePro Sonic also comes with an absurd number of attachments (eight): a round head for sore muscles, a shovel for back pain, a flat tip for a deep tissue massage, a pointer for sensitive knots, a bullet for small muscles, a fingertip for trigger points, spinal for lower back, and a textured tip for larger muscles. It’s not the lightest at 2.5 pounds, but for the price, this tool is an excellent addition to your gym setup or post-workout recovery routine.—Boutayna Chokrane</p><p>Jump to a Topic:Best Tech Deals,Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Home Office Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Beauty Deals,Best Mobile Phone Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers),Best TV Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Pet Deals,Best Outdoor Deals</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite Android phones, and this deal is one of the best prices we’ve tracked so far. This super-smart smartphone is packed with a spate ofAI featuresthat make your day-to-day life easier—including Direct My Call (which helps you navigate automated menu options), a ton of photo editing tools, Circle to Search, and more. The Pixel 9 Pro has an excellent camera, plus a vapor-chamber cooling system that helps dissipate heat better than other phones we’ve tried (and other phones in the Pixel 9 lineup). The phone will get software upgrades for seven years. Don’t forget acase! —Louryn Strampe</p><p>The Nubia Redmagic 10 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a mobile gaming beast with excellent battery life, silky performance, and a lovely 6.8-inch screen with a144-Hz refresh rate. Relatively affordable for a phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, this device is all about gaming and includes a built-in fan to keep cool, programmable buttons, and highly customizable gaming software. Shoddy software, limited updates, and an inconsistent camera are downsides, but this is real value for gamers, especially at the discounted price. —Simon Hill</p><p>Thebest smart displayto invest in isn’t technically a smart display, but a tablet. The Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is an Android tablet with a speaker docking station, letting it transform into a powerful little smart display when you aren’t using the tablet. It’s got good performance, a sharp LCD screen, and robust speakers. Both the tablet with the docking station andthe tablet aloneare on sale, but this tablet really shines when you’re able to use it all day long. It’s a better deal for the included speaker, too, versus the tablet alone. The Google Pixel has been running my smart home devices for months, and I have no desire to go back to a smart-display-only gadget in my house.—Nena Farrell</p><p>This is our favorite ultrathin case in our guide to theBest iPhone 16 cases. It’s composed of 100 percent biodegradable packaging with a woven aramid fiber that adds a super soft feel. Despite its thin design, it comes with MagSafe built in, too. It also comes in some fun patterns. It’s worth noting the buttons are exposed, so if that’s a concern, I suggest going for another case. This one will keep the back of your phone safe from scratches, but it won’t do much to protect your display if you drop it.—Brenda Stolyar</p><p>Jump to a Topic:Best Tech Deals,Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Home Office Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Beauty Deals,Best Mobile Phone Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers),Best TV Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Pet Deals,Best Outdoor Deals</p><p>It has occasionally dipped a little lower, but this is a solid price onSamsung’s latest smartwatch. It’s best paired with a Samsung phone to access a few extra features, like the electrocardiogram and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, but will otherwise work with all Android phones. Performance is smooth, the health tracking is excellent, but battery life is a little annoying—it’ll just about enough to get through a day, not much more. I recommendgrabbing the 44-mm variant; it’s a bit bigger but that means better battery life. —Julian Chokkattu</p><p>TestingGoogle’s Pixel Watch 3is the first time I believed editor Julian Chokkattu when he said “round is better than square.” It’s one of thebest-looking smartwatchesand one of thebest-looking fitness trackersfor anyone withan Android phone. I recommend staying with this larger 45-mm model for better battery life, especially if you work out a lot. I have mixed feelings about theAI coaching features, but Fitbit is still one of the best fitness platforms available and Google’s integration with it is virtually perfect.—Adrienne So</p><p>Want a big, premium smartwatch for your Android phone? Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the Apple Watch Ultra equivalent, with a beefy screen and battery.

You can get a battery-impregnated stand and plug it straight into the projector, which is about the size and shape of a Stanley water cup. It has a cute little speaker on the bottom and can even flip up to shoot images at the ceiling, which makes it fun to add ambience when you’re not watching shows and movies.—Parker Hall</p><p>Beats took its time renewing its popular Pill Bluetooth speaker, but the wait was worth it. The latest Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a posh design, great sound, and loads of features, from solid water resistance to a USB-C input for lossless audio playback. Its zippy sound signature goes heavy on the bass and treble but both are presented with care and musicality, and its mix of keen instrumental textures and stereo separation place it among the top performers in its class. The Pill’s stylish frame isn’t as drop-friendly as rivals from JBL or UE, but at $100 this is an easy decision for anyone eyeing a solid Bluetooth buddy.—Ryan Waniata</p><p>These perfectly sized speakers will bring a rich, clear sound to your desktop. They come in black or white with angled stands to fire the audio into your ears. Our current pick of thebest computer speakersunder $200, the M60 speakers are already a bargain, so this discount makes them irresistible for anyone in the market. While they offer decent bass, it can get a bit muddy, and the touch controls are slightly annoying, but that’s it for weaknesses. Connectivity choices include USB-C (which will be best for most folks), 3.5 mm, or Bluetooth 5.3.—Simon Hill</p><p>Ultimate Ears’ Megaboom is my favorite big-boy speaker. Its larger size means it’s not the easiest to throw in a backpack, but it is up for any adventure thanks to a drop- and weather-proof frame and great sound. I like Ultimate Ears’ app that lets you customize speaker options like an alarm or the ability to wake the speaker from sleep right from your phone. The sound is powerful and full, with plenty of detail, and the playtime of up to 20 hours should keep you jamming in all but the most extended excursions. This speaker sees regular sales, sometimes below this price, but if you’re ready to grab your next patio companion now’s a good time.—Ryan Waniata</p><p>The Everboom is a solid offering from Ultimate Ears, one of our favorite Bluetooth speaker makers. The only real issue I took with the speaker in myEverboom reviewis that its sound quality and features are remarkably similar to the Megaboom 4, which costs $50 less. Issue resolved! If you’re looking for a powerful and uniquely designed Bluetooth speaker with loads of extras to pump up your outdoor jams, at $200 or less the Everboom is a solid choice.—Ryan Waniata</p><p>This isn’t a sale so much as the new regular price, but anytime you can get this speaker at $60 or less it’s well worth considering. I like its smooth and warm sound that pays good attention to detail.

I also like the charging case, which is a cute little egg that slides easily into pockets and bags.—Parker Hall</p><p>Soundcore’s Liberty 4 NC (8/10, WIRED Recommends) aren’t just another AirPods clone. They’re anotherAirPodsProclone, and a good one at that, offering excellent battery life, clear and detailed sound, and tons of customization options at a fraction of what you’ll pay for Apple’s best buds. You’re not getting Apple’s exclusive features, of course, but if you want a great experience with stem-style buds for less, this is one of my favorite pairs. The customization in Soundcore’s app alone is nearly worth the entry fee, and the buds themselves are well-built and comfy. I had a few problems with the touch controls, but otherwise it’s hard to criticize buds that rise above their price point in nearly every way that counts.—Ryan Waniata</p><p>We see this discount frequently, but we’d be remiss not to include it here since it’s the best deal we see for thebest headphoneswe’ve tried. Of the dozens, if not hundreds, of pairs of headphones our reviewers have tested, the WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take the cake in terms of battery life (30 hours), sound quality (thanks to Sony processing and 30-mm drivers), and noise cancelation (complete with automatic audio pausing).—Louryn Strampe</p><p>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are thebest wireless earbudsfor Android owners. They’re small and cute, with a supremely comfortable fit and fantastic noise canceling. The battery lasts for eight hours and the sound quality is great, too. They even have IP54 water resistance, so you can take ’em to the gym. It’s not hard to find a goodinexpensive pair of earbudsthese days, but we don’t see these go on sale very often, making now a better time to pick them up.—Louryn Strampe</p><p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it many times again, I’m sure: Anker’s Soundcore line makes a meanbudget headphone. The Space A40 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) noise-canceling buds are longtime favorites for their mix of clear and full sound, solid mid-tier noise cancelation, and plenty of features rolled into a comfy design. The biggest argument against these buds is their lack of auto-pause, which means you’ll need to stay on your toes when you pull a bud out during your favorite true crime podcast. Otherwise, it’s hard to argue against their value, especially since their price has sunk like a stone to nearly half their original MSRP.—Ryan Waniata</p><p>A sale on the Life Q30 is really just doubling down on value. Even at full price, these rank among thebest noise-canceling headphonesI’ve tested for the money. Along with solid noise canceling, highlights include a comfy design, a great companion app, and up to 40 hours of playtime. I’ve taken these headphones on a cross-country flight and had no trouble enjoying my favorite music and movies thanks to their ability to quell engine drone and background noise. The soft plastic tends to scratch easily and they don’t have all the features of top models like the Bose QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) or Sony XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but at a fraction of the cost, they’re a guilt-free budget buy.—Ryan Waniata</p><p>This is a less exciting deal now that the newBeats Powerbeats Pro 2have come out. But if you’re an Apple user who doesn’t want to spend $250, then Beats’ previous headphones topped ourBest Workout Headphonesguide for years. (When they were released, we even called them“Apple’s best earbuds ever.”) They’re insanely comfortable, have great battery life and an excellent sound signature, work well with all Apple devices, and despitea modest IPX4 rating, are hardy and durable. I dunked my head under a hose at full blast while wearing them and they were fine.—Adrienne So</p><p>If I had to buy my ownworkout headphonesinstead of testing them, I would probably buy a pair of the Shokz OpenRuns in any of the company’s models, whether it’s this, the original OpenRun, or theOpenRun mini, for people who have smaller necks. These headphones are just leagues away in terms of build and sound quality than the other competitors of this type, they fit under a helmet for biking and skateboarding, and the newest version has USB-C charging so you don’t have to hunt for that dumb proprietary cable anymore.—Adrienne So</p><p>If you work out in a busy city, or you’re cycling to work and need to hear the cars on the road around you, open bone-conduction headphones like the OpenRun Pro are a good option that allow you to still enjoy your tunes. This is an older model from 2022 (8/10, WIRED Recommends), but it still works great for most folks, especially at this discounted price.—Parker Hall</p><p>Bose isn’t in the business of making the second-best noise-canceling headphones. When it comes to crushing your sonic annoyances to a pulp, nobody beats the QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends). These headphones offer rich and clear sound, plush comfort in a posh design, and the best noise canceling you can get for your money. Whether transforming traffic to a whisper or dialing back irksome vocal chatter and even barking dogs, the QC Ultra are the best we’ve tested with a price tag to match. They even offer extras like a transparency mode limiter to keep loud noises from hurting your ears. This is one of the better QC Ultra sales we’ve seen, so if you’re ready to enjoy the silence Depeche Mode style, now’s a good time.—Ryan Waniata</p><p>The Studio Buds Plus were among the first earbuds to show Beats had truly turned the corner on a new audio era. They’re not the best noise-canceling buds around but they’ve got a cool look, solid performance, and a handy swath of features for both Android and Apple phones. Maybe most notable is their dial design which makes the buds incredibly easy to insert and control, both real-life conveniences that often get overlooked by reviewers and buyers alike. I wouldn’t suggest you buy the Studio Plus at full price these days, but they’re usually on sale well below their retail cost and right now they're particularly tempting.—Ryan Waniata</p><p>This is one of my favoriteAirPods cases, specifically because it comes with magnets that support MagSafe accessories. Of course, it’s protective too, with a shock-absorbing hard shell along with top and bottom pieces that shut via magnets (which helps keep the lid from accidentally sliding off). It’s bulkier than other cases I’ve used, but it’s not enough to be a deal-breaker. It also comes in a really cute pink color.

Simply pass it over a surface a few times, back and forth, and be amazed at how quickly and thoroughly it gets rid of pet fur. It’s easy to empty, too. Press the button on the back side of the roller and get rid of the fur inside. It’s infinitely reusable—I’ve owned one for nearly six years and it’s still going strong.

Technically,all cats are polycats, but I thought it was neat to see the primary species markers that my cat Luna carries since she adopted me off the street. This test also checks your cat’s DNA against over 100 feline health markers, testing for risk levels regarding kidney health, cardiovascular conditions, and more. It’s not as comprehensive as a human DNA test, but I have zero regrets. —Louryn Strampe</p><p>A top pick in our guide to theBest Cat Water Fountains, this 2.4-liter model with a stainless steel bowl pumps water through a cheery plastic daisy. (It does make an audible splashing noise if the water level dips below the reservoir midpoint, but you get used to it.) The center of the flower comes out for faster water flow, or remove it altogether if your cat would rather drink from a lower, springlike burble. The inside is lit by a blue LED so you can see the water level at all times, and refills of the cotton-carbon-resin filters are easy to find and reasonable ata little over $1 each.Inexpensive fountains like this are usually hit or miss in terms of quality, but this one has been going strong in our long-term testing for over three months.—Kat Merck</p><p>The Petkit PuraMax 2 is my second-favoriteautomatic litter box. With this box, owners can monitor cats’ usage through an app, and the box cleans litter via rotation, using a grate system to separate the waste from the clean litter (when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling). This box has triple odor control, with a sealed waste bin; an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin; and a smart, citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. Not only does this litter box smell neutral, dare I say it smells … good? At $430, this is the lowest price we’ve ever seen it. But I’d argue that never having to scoop dirty litter again is priceless.—Molly Higgins</p><p>This is my top pick forCat Water Fountainsbecause it's reliable, safe, and easy to clean with a cordless pump. The basin sits on a dock, the stainless steel bowl snaps on top of the basin for easy cleaning and refilling, and the basin holds 130 milliliters in the bowl at all times in case of power outage. The fountain also has a low-water detection system, automatically stopping if water levels get too low. The connected app records when your cat drank, how much they drank, and for how long. This is the automatic fountain I recommend to people, and at $40, this is generally the lowest we see the price drop.—Molly Higgins</p><p>Thiscat water fountainbecame one of my top choices because my cats were obsessed with it. This automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered, lasting up to 83 days using only the battery. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed, and the app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you need to refill the water. The water flow can be standard flow, intermittent (three minutes on and off), or battery (where the water flow time and sleeping mode time are fully customizable), or you can pause the water flow altogether and just use the basin reserve.—Molly Higgins</p><p>This fountain is super helpful for people who have pets with health issues. Using a collar tag to monitor which cat is using the device and for how long, you can compare and track health data (for up to five pets). The Petlibro app alerts you when your pet's consumption is down or up, and you can set hydration goals, which the app will let you know have been met or not. Thisautomatic fountainis especially useful for pet parents of elderly male cats or those who have had health issues with UTIs to more easily monitor and track changes. We’ve seen the price dip lower, but at 20 bucks off, this is a good investment to make to save you costly vet bills and encourage water-drinking.—Molly Higgins</p><p>This circularautomatic fountainconnects to an app to monitor water levels and remind you when it’s time to change the filter and refill, and has a wireless pump that pushes water from the basin into the top lip, circulating continuously. The top part also has a small reservoir that keeps 60 milliliters of water in the tray at all times, ensuring your kitty always has access to water. It has a circular filter, and the pump also has a foam filter and UV light to further sterilize water by killing potentially harmful bacteria. For a little over 50 bucks, this is a solid investment in your cats’ well-being.—Molly Higgins</p><p>I cannot tell you how much I love thisautomatic feeder. The built-in camera gives me so much peace of mind when I’m away. The camera also has night vision so you can watch and hear your pet 24/7, and you can even communicate with them via speaker. It's controlled via an app and dispenses food from its 5-liter capacity based on the feeding schedule you create. The app is easy to use with extremely customizable feeding plans with meals that you label individually. Now on sale for around $100, this savvy little device reliably feeds my cats daily and doubles as a security cam when I’m away.—Molly Higgins</p><p>I deemed thisautomatic litter box“Best for Helicopter Parents” (8/10 WIRED Recommends) because it doubles as both a livestream of your cat’s goings-on inside the litter box and a security cam on the outside. This is the lowest price we’ve ever seen, at $200 off. Using a camera and AI technology, the litter box identifies which cat used the box (and you can view your cat’s stool to help more closely monitor their health), while the app logs and monitors usage—including the number of times used and the average duration. Although a little pricey, an automatic litter box is a game-changing investment—especially since it’s below a thousand dollars right now.—Molly Higgins</p><p>Jump to a Topic:Best Tech Deals,Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Home Office Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Beauty Deals,Best Mobile Phone Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers),Best TV Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Pet Deals,Best Outdoor Deals</p><p>As we’ve found in almost a year of testing for our guide to theBest Smart Bird Feeders, there are no problem-free smart bird feeders (yet)—every model we’ve tested has had at least some issues, whether with connectivity, app user-friendliness, or quality of the cameras or body casing. With that in mind, this feeder has fewer issues than most, especially when considering value, features, and reliability. The AI isn’t perfect and requires a subscription and the auxiliary solar panel is finicky, but theIP65-rated plastic body makes it easy to clean, the 1080p camera is solid for the price, and it offers color night vision. Just be forewarned that it only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the included strap won’t work with most trees, so be prepared to use the bracket mount.—Kat Merck</p><p>As seen in our guide to theBest Smart Bird Feeders, this modern-looking wood model was deemed the best-looking smart bird feeder by former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano. It’s made of FCS-certified bamboo, with black-painted sides and the ability to fill with two different types of seed. It’s got a solar panel for charging, but that needs to be mounted separately, and a subscription is required to unlock many of its features, like AI bird identification. The wood body isIP65-ratedand Birdfy says it’s mold- and rot-resistant, but do note it will need to be finished with abird-safe wood sealantprior to use. This likely still will not result in its lasting as long as a plastic model, especially if you live someplace with a lot of moisture, but it may be a worthwhile tradeoff for those who don’t want tacky blue or yellow plastic messing up their backyard ~vibes~.—Kat Merck</p><p>Despite poor AI identification performance and a middling app, I quite liked the reliability and easy setup of thisHonorable Mention-earning smart bird feeder. Many of the features users expect (like the ability to take video) require a subscription to unlock, but this is one of the rare budget smart feeder cameras that offers lighted night vision, and birds really seem to like the feeder itself, whether due to its color, extended perch, or generous (2L) seed capacity. Longer-term testing also found it to hold up well to heavy and/or persistent squirrels.—Kat Merck</p><p>The latest hummingbird feeder from Netvue subsidiary Birdfy, maker of our favoriteSmart Bird Feeder, this 20-ounce model features dual cameras (one front, one side) with impressive 2K resolution and HD video. Both camera views are shown split-screen in Birdfy’s easy-to-use app, and I quite enjoyed watching the various angles of hummingbirds who came to graze at the feeder’s trio of red plastic flowers. That is, while the feeder was working. Our test unit is now defunct due to a faulty sensor, but reviews throughout the internet indicate this was likely an anomaly.—Kat Merck</p><p>TheRepel Umbrellais sturdy, capable of handling high winds, and has good coverage when it’s open. There’s also a single button that opens and collapses the fiberglass ribs (it collapses down to just a foot in length too). You’ll have your choice among a variety of stunning colors, too. Our only gripe is that it’s tough to close and requires two hands. Your other option is to use the ground as leverage and push the handle down.—Brenda Stolyar</p><p>If you’re shopping for a compact andpowerful flashlightforlate-night walksor emergency kits, this is a solid pick at $25. The Anker Bolder LC90 blasts 900 lumens, enough to temporarily disorient a threat, and it even has a strobe mode for extra deterrence. Unlike pepper spray or mace, there’s no risk of accidentally blinding yourself, and if the threat turns out to be a non-threat, no harm is done. It’s rechargeable, water-resistant, and small enough to toss into a tote bag.—Boutayna Chokrane</p><p>Jump to a Topic:Best Tech Deals,Best Amazon Device Deals,Best Home Deals,Best Home Office Deals,Best Kitchen Deals,Best Beauty Deals,Best Mobile Phone Deals,Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers),Best TV Deals,Best Speaker Deals,Best Headphone Deals,Best Pet Deals,Best Outdoor Deals</p>

    <h1>Beneath Greenland’s Ice Lies a Climate Solution—and a New Geopolitical Battleground</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 26, 2025</span>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>This story was produced byGristand copublished with Wired. It was supported by the Pulitzer Center.</p><p>Greenland’s massive cap of ice, containing enough fresh water to raise sea levels by 23 feet,is in serious trouble. Between 2002 and 2023, Greenland lost270 billion tonsof frozen water each year as winter snowfall failed to compensate for ever-fiercer summer temperatures. That's a significant contributor of sea level rise globally, which is now at aquarter of an incha year.</p><p>But underneath all that melting ice is something the whole world wants: the rare earth elements that make modern society—and the clean energy revolution—possible. That could soon turn Greenland, which has a population size similar to that of Casper, Wyoming, into a mining mecca.</p><p>Greenland’s dominant industry has long been fishing, but its government is now looking to diversify its economy. While the island has opened up a handful of mines, like for gold and rubies, its built and natural environment makes drilling a nightmare—freezing conditions on remote sites without railways or highways for access. The country's rich reserves of rare earths and geopolitical conflict, however, are making the island look increasingly enticing to mining companies, Arctic conditions be damned.</p><p>When President Donald Trump talks about the United States acquiring Greenland, it’s partly for itsstrategic trade and military locationin the Arctic but also for its mineral resources. According toone Greenland official, the island “possesses 39 of the50 mineralsthat the United States has classified as critical to national security and economic stability.” While the island, an autonomous territory of Denmark, has made clear it is not for sale, its government is signaling it is open to business, particularly in the minerals sector. Earlier this month, Greenland’s electionssaw the ascendanceof the pro-business Demokraatit Party, which has promised toaccelerate the developmentof the country’s minerals and other resources. At the same time, the party’s leadership ispushing back hard against Trump’s rhetoric.</p><p>Rare earth elements are fundamental to daily life: These words you are reading on a screen are made of the ones and zeroes of binary code. But they’re also made of rare earth elements, such as the terbium in LED screens, praseodymium in batteries, and neodymium in a phone’s vibration unit. Depending on where you live, the electricity powering this screen may have even come from the dysprosium in wind turbines.</p><p>These minerals helped build the modern world—and will be in increasing demand going forward. “They sit at the heart of pretty much every electric vehicle, cruise missile, advanced magnet,” said Adam Lajeunesse, a public policy expert at Canada's St. Francis Xavier University. “All of these different minerals are absolutely required to build almost everything that we do in our high-tech environment.”</p><p>To the increasing alarm of Western powers, China now has a stranglehold on the market for rare earth elements, responsible for70 percent of productionglobally. As the renewables revolution unfolds, and as more EVs hit the road, the world will demand ever more of these metals: Between 2020 and 2022, the total value of rare earths used in the energy transition each yearquadrupled. That is projected to go up another tenfold by 2035. According to the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, by 2030, Greenland could provide nearly 10,000 tons of rare earth oxides to the global economy.</p><p>One way to meet that demand, and for the world to diversify control over the rare earths market and speed up clean energy adoption, is to mine in Greenland. (In other words, the way to avoid future ice melt may, ironically, mean capitalizing on the riches revealed by climate-driven ice loss.) On the land currently exposed along the island’s edges, mining companies are starting to drill, and the US doesn’t want to be left out of the action.</p><p>But anyone gung-ho on immediately turning Greenland into a rare earths bonanza is in for a rude awakening. More so than elsewhere on the planet, mining the island is an extremely complicated, and lengthy, proposition—logistically, geopolitically, and economically. And most importantly for the people of Greenland, mining of any kind comes with inevitable environmental consequences, like pollution and disruptions to wildlife.</p><p>The Trump administration’s aggressive language has spooked Indigenous Greenlanders in particular, who make up 90 percent of the population and have endured a long history ofbrutal colonization, from deadly waves of disease and displacement to forced sterilization. “It's been a shock for Greenland,” said Aqqaluk Lynge, former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council and cofounder of Greenland’s Inuit Ataqatigiit political party. “They are looking at us as people that you just can throw out.”</p><p>Lacking the resources to directly invest in mining for rare earths, the Greenland government is approving licenses for exploration. “We have all the critical minerals. Everyone wants them,” said Jørgen T. Hammeken-Holm, permanent secretary for mineral resources in the Greenland government. “The geology is so exciting, but there are a lot of ‘buts.’”</p><p>The funny thingabout rare earth elements is that they’re not particularly rare. Planet Earth is loaded with them—only in an annoyingly distributed manner. Miners have to process a lot of rock to pluck out small amounts of praseodymium, neodymium, and the 15 other rare earth elements. That makes the minerals very difficult and dirty to mine and then refine: For every ton of rare earths dug up,2,000 tons of toxic wasteare generated.</p><p>China’s government cornered the market on rare earths by both subsidizing the industry and streamlining regulations. “If you can purchase something from a Chinese company which does not have the same labor regulations, human rights considerations, environmental considerations as you would in Australia or California, you'll buy it more cheaply on the Chinese market,” Lajeunesse said. Many critical minerals that are mined elsewhere in the world still go back to China, because the country has spent decades building up its refining capacity.</p><p>China has used the rare earths market as an economic and political weapon. In 2010, the so-called Rare Earths Trade Dispute broke out, when China refused to ship the minerals to Japan—a country famous for its manufacturing of technologies. (However,some researchers questionwhether this was a deliberate embargo or a Chinese effort to reduce rare earth exports generally.) More subtly, China can manipulate the market on rare earths by, say, increasing production to drive down prices. This makes it less economically feasible for other mining outfits to get into the game, given the cost and difficulty of extracting the minerals, solidifying China’s grip on rare earths.</p><p>“They control every stage—the mining of it, and then the intermediate processing, and then the more sophisticated final product processing,” said Heather Exner-Pirot, director of energy, natural resources and environment at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a think tank in Canada. “So they can intervene in the market at all these levels.”</p><p>This is a precarious monopoly for Western economies and governments to navigate. Military aircraft and drones use permanent magnets made of terbium and dysprosium. Medical imaging equipment also relies on rare earths, as do flatscreens and electric motors. It’s not just the energy transition that needs a steady supply of these minerals, but modern life itself.</p><p>As a result, all eyes are turning toward Greenland’s rich deposits of rare earths. The island contains 18 percent of the global reserves for neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium, according to the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre. Even a decade ago,scientists reportedthat the island could meet a quarter of the global demand for rare earths.</p><p>The question iswhether mining companies can overcome the headaches inherent in extracting rare earths from Greenland’s ice-free yet still frigid edges. An outfit would have to ship in all their equipment and build their own city at a remote mining site at considerable cost. On top of that, it would be difficult to actually hire enough workers from the island’s population of laborers, so a mining company may need to hire internationally and bring them in. Greenland has a population of 57,000, just 65 of whom were involved in mining as of 2020, so the requisite experience just isn’t there. “Labor laws are much more strict than they would be in a Chinese rare earth mine in Mongolia,” Lajeunesse said. “All of those things factor together to make Arctic development very expensive.”</p><p>Still, the geopolitical pressure from China’s domination of the rare earths market has opened Greenland to exploration. No one needs to wait for further deterioration of the island’s ice sheet to get to work, as there’s enough ice-free land along these edges to dig through. Around 40 mining companies have exploration, prospecting, and exploitation licenses in Greenland, with the majority of the firms based in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. “We can give you these minerals,” Hammeken-Holm said, “but you need to come to Greenland and do the exploration.”</p><p>One of those companies is Critical Metals Corp., which in September drilled 14 holes on the coast of southern Greenland, about 16 miles from the town of Qaqortoq. The New York-based company says it’s found one of the world’s highest concentrations of gallium, which isn’t technically a rare earth element but is still essential in the manufacturing of computer chips.</p><p>Dramatic change on and around the island, though, could make mining for rare earths even more complicated. While the loss of floating ice in the waters around the island makes it easier and safer for ships to navigate, more chunks of glaciers will drop into the ocean as the world warms, which could become especially hazardous for ships, à la theTitanic.</p><p>Even given the rapid loss of Greenland’s 650,000-square-mile ice sheet, though, it would take a long while to lose it all—it’s 1.4 miles thick on average. The Earth itself is also frozen in parts of the island, known as permafrost,which will thaw in the nearer termas temperatures rise. “That's going to give you certainly instability in terms of building access roads and such,” said Paul Bierman, a geologist at the University of Vermont and author of the bookWhen the Ice Is Gone: What a Greenland Ice Core Reveals About Earth's Tumultuous History and Perilous Future. “The climate is changing, so I think it's going to be a very dynamic environment in which to extract minerals.”</p><p>Mining pollution, too, is a major concern: The accessible land along the island’s ice-free edges is also where humans live. As mining equipment and ships burn fossil fuels, they produce black carbon. When this settles on ice, it darkens the surface, which then absorbs more sunlight—think of how much hotter you get wearing a black shirt than a white shirt on a summer day. This couldfurther accelerate the meltingof Greenland’s precarious ice sheet. A 2022studyalso found that three legacy mines in Greenland heavily polluted the local environment with metals, like lead and zinc, due to the lack of environmental studies and regulation prior to the 1970s. But it also found no significant pollution at mines established in the last 20 years.</p><p>A more immediate problem with mining is the potentially toxic dust generated by so much machinery, said Niels Henrik Hooge, a campaigner at NOAH, the Danish chapter of the environmental organization Friends of the Earth. “That's a concern, because all the mining projects are located in areas where people live, or potentially could live,” Hooge said. “Everything is a bit different in the Arctic, because the environment does not recover very quickly when polluted.”</p><p>Lynge says that a win-win for Greenlanders would be to support mining but insist that it’s run on hydropower instead of fossil fuels. The island hashuge potential for hydropower, and indeed has beenapproving more projectsand expandinganother existing facility. Still, no amount of hydropower can negate the impact of mining on the landscape. “There's no sustainable mining in the world,” Lynge said. “The question is if we can do it a little bit better.”</p><p>Critical Metals Corp., for its part, says that it expects to produce minimal harmful products at its site. Like other mining projects in Greenland, it will need to pass an environmental review. “We expect to provide more updates about our plans to reduce our environmental footprint as we get closer to mining operations,” said Tony Sage, the company’s CEO and executive chairman, in a statement provided to Grist. “With that, we believe it is important to keep in mind that rare earth elements are critical materials for cleaner applications, which will help us build a greener planet in the future.”</p><p>Still, wherever there’s mining activity, there’s potential for spills. There’s also potential for a lot of noise: Ships in particular fill the ocean around Greenland with a din that can stress and disorient fishes and marine mammals, like narwhals, seals, and whales. For vocalizing species, it can disrupt their communication.</p><p>There’s a lot at stake here economically and politically, too: Fishing is Greenland’s predominant industry, accounting for95 percentof the island’s exports. Rare earth mining, then, is the island’s play to diversify its economy, which could help it wean off the subsidies it gets from the Danish government. That, in turn, could help itwin independence.</p><p>Thus far, the mining business has been a bit rocky in Greenland. In 2021, the governmentbanned uranium mining, halting the development of a project by the Australian outfit Greenland Minerals, which would have also produced rare earths at the site. (Greenland Minerals did not respond to multiple requests to comment for this story.) The China-linked companyis now suingthe Greenland government for $11 billion—potentially spooking other would-be prospectors and the investors already worried about the profitability of mining for rare earths in the far north.</p><p>“When we talk to them, they understand the situation, and they're not afraid,” said Hammeken-Holm. He added that Greenland maintains a dialogue with mining outfits about the challenges, and prospects, of exploration. “It is difficult to get private finance for these projects, but we are not alone,” he said. “That's a worldwide situation.”</p><p>The growing demandand geopolitical fervor around rare earths may well make Greenland irresistible for mining companies, regardless of the logistical challenges. Hammeken-Holm says that a major discovery, like an especially rich deposit of a given rare earth element, might be the extra boost the country needs to transform itself into an indispensable provider of the critical minerals.</p><p>Both Exner-Pirot, of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, and Lajeunesse, the public policy expert, say that Western powers might get to the point where they intervene aggressively in the market. Like China’s state-sponsored rare earths industry, the US, Canada, Australia, or the European Union—whichentered into a strategic partnershipwith Greenland in 2023 to develop critical raw materials—might band together to guarantee a steady flow of the minerals that make modern militaries, consumerism, and the energy transition possible. Subsidies, for instance, would help make the industry more profitable—and palatable for investors. “You'd have to accept that you're purchasing and developing minerals for more than the market price,” Lajeunesse said. “But over the long term, it's about developing a security of supply.”</p><p>Already a land of rapid climatological change, Greenland could soon grow richer—and more powerful on the world stage. Ton by ton, its disappearing ice will reveal more of the mineral solutions to the world’s woes.</p><p>Tom Vaillant contributed research and reporting. This story is part of the Grist seriesUnearthed: The Mining Issue, which examines the global race to extract critical minerals for the clean energy transition.</p>

Way Day (god I hate that) is their best sale of the season, but they too join the rat race for our hard-earned dollars and hold big sales during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, and an End of Year Clearance Sale. Basically, every major (or minor) holiday has a sale along with it. During these sales, there are site wide discounts along with discounts targeted for the season, like outdoor furniture sales during the spring and summer.</p>

    <h1>It’s Looking More Likely NASA Will Fly the Artemis II Mission</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Late Saturday night,technicians at Kennedy Space Center in Florida moved the core stage forNASA’ssecond Space Launch System rocket into position between the vehicle’s two solid-fueled boosters.</p><p>Working inside the iconic 52-story-tall Vehicle Assembly Building, ground teams used heavy-duty cranes to first lift the butterscotch-orange core stage from its cradle in the VAB’s cavernous transfer aisle, the central passageway between the building’s four rocket assembly bays. The cranes then rotated the structure vertically, allowing workers to disconnect one of the cranes from the bottom of the rocket.</p><p>That left the rocket hanging on a 325-ton overhead crane, which would lift it over the transom into the building’s northeast high bay. The Boeing-built core stage weighs about 94 tons (85 metric tons), measures about 212 feet (65 meters) tall, and will contain 730,000 gallons of cryogenic propellant at liftoff. It is the single largest element for NASA’sArtemis II mission, slated to ferry a crew of astronauts around the far side of themoonas soon as next year.</p><p>Finally, ground crews lowered the rocket between the Space Launch System’s twin solid rocket boosters already stacked on a mobile launch platform inside High Bay 3, where NASA assembled Space Shuttles and Saturn V rockets for Apollo lunar missions.</p><p>This story originally appeared onArs Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED’s parent company, Condé Nast.</p><p>On Sunday, teams inside the VAB connected the core stage to each booster at forward and aft load-bearing attach points. After completing electrical and data connections, engineers will stack a cone-shaped adapter on top of the core stage, followed by the rocket’s upper stage, another adapter ring, and finally the Orion spacecraft that will be home to the four-person Artemis II crew for their 10-day journey through deep space.</p><p>The Space Launch System's core stage is seen sandwiched between the rocket's twin solid-fueled boosters inside the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p><p>Caption: Four RS-25 engines left over from NASA’s Space Shuttle program will power the SLS core stage.Credit: NASA/Frank Michaux</p><p>This will be the first crewed flight of NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the lunar south pole and eventually build a sustainable human presence on the moon, with an eye toward future expeditions to Mars. The program’s first crewed lunar landing is penciled in for the Artemis III mission, again using SLS and Orion, but adding a new piece:SpaceX’senormous Starship rocket will be used as a human-rated lunar lander. Artemis II won’t land, but it will carry people to the vicinity of the moon for the first time since 1972.</p><p>The core stage for Artemis II arrived from its factory in Louisiana last year, and NASA started stacking the SLS solid rocket boosters in November. Other recent accomplishments on the path toward Artemis II include the installation of the Orion spacecraft’s solar panels, and closeouts of the craft’s service module at Kennedy Space Center with aerodynamic panels that will jettison during launch.</p><p>As soon as next month, the Orion spacecraft will travel to a different facility at Kennedy for fueling, then to another building to meet its Launch Abort System before moving to the VAB for stacking atop the Space Launch System. Ahead of the uncrewed Artemis I mission in 2022, it took around eight months to complete these activities before delivering Orion to the VAB, so it’s fair to be skeptical of NASA’s target launch date for Artemis II in April 2026, which is already running years behind schedule.</p><p>However, the slow march toward launch continues. A few months ago, some well-informed people in the space community thought there was a real possibility the Trump administration could quickly cancel NASA’s Space Launch System, the high-priced heavy-lifter designed to send astronauts from the Earth to the moon. The most immediate possibility involved terminating the SLS program before it flies with Artemis II.</p><p>This possibility appears to have been overcome by circumstances. The rockets most often mentioned as stand-ins for the Space Launch System—SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s New Glenn—aren’t likely to be cleared for crew missions for at least several years.</p><p>The Orion spacecraft for the Artemis II mission, seen here with its solar arrays installed for flight, just prior to their enclosure inside aerodynamic fairings to protect them during launch.</p><p>The fully reusable Starship holds immense long-term promise to be significantly cheaper and more capable than the Space Launch System, but it suffered back-to-back failures to start the year, raising questions about SpaceX’s upgraded Starship design, known as “Version 2” or “Block 2.” Once SpaceX irons out the design issues, it must prove it can recover and reuse Starships and test the vehicle’s in-orbit refueling capabilities. Blue Origin’s New Glenn had a successful debut flight in January, but its next flight is likely six or more months away.</p><p>NASA’s existing architecture still has a limited shelf life, and the agency will probably have multiple options for transporting astronauts to and from the moon in the 2030s. A decision on the long-term future of SLS and Orion isn’t expected until the Trump administration’s nominee for NASA administrator, Jared Isaacman, takes office after confirmation by the Senate.</p><p>There are different degrees of cancellation options. The most draconian would be an immediate order to stop work on Artemis II preparations. This is looking less likely than it did a few months ago and would come with its own costs. It would cost untold millions of dollars to disassemble and dispose of parts of Artemis II’s SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. Canceling multibillion-dollar contracts with Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin would put NASA on the hook for significant termination costs.</p><p>Of course, these liabilities would be less than the $4.1 billion NASA’s inspector general estimates each of the first four Artemis missions will cost. Most of that money has already been spent for Artemis II, but if NASA spends several billion dollars on each Artemis mission, there won’t be much money left over to do other cool things.</p><p>Other options for NASA might be to set a transition point when the Artemis program would move off of the Space Launch System rocket, and perhaps even the Orion spacecraft, and switch to new vehicles.</p><p>Looking down on the Space Launch System for Artemis II.</p><p>Another possibility, which seems to be low-hanging fruit for Artemis decision-makers, could be to cancel the development of a larger Exploration Upper Stage for the SLS rocket. If there are a finite number of SLS flights on NASA’s schedule, it’s difficult to justify the projected $5.7 billion cost of developing the upgraded Block 1B version of the Space Launch System. There are commercial options available to replace the rocket’s Boeing-built Exploration Upper Stage, as my colleague Eric Berger aptlydescribed in a feature storylast year.</p><p>For now, it looks like NASA’s orange behemoth has a little life left in it. All the hardware for the Artemis II mission has arrived at the launch site in Florida.</p><p>The Trump administration will release its fiscal-year 2026 budget request in the coming weeks. Maybe then NASA will also have a permanent administrator, and the veil will lift over the White House’s plans for Artemis.</p><p>This story originally appeared onArs Technica.</p>

    <h1>Databricks Has a Trick That Lets AI Models Improve Themselves</h1>

        <p>To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories.</p><p>Databricks, a companythat helps big businesses build customartificial intelligencemodels, has developed a machine-learning trick that can boost the performance of an AI model without the need for clean labeled data.</p><p>Jonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, spent the past year talking to customers about the key challenges they face in getting AI to work reliably.</p><p>The problem, Frankle says, is dirty data.</p><p>”Everybody has some data, and has an idea of what they want to do,” Frankle says. But the lack of clean data makes it challenging to fine-tune a model to perform a specific task. “Nobody shows up with nice, clean fine-tuning data that you can stick into a prompt or an [application programming interface]” for a model.</p><p>Databricks’ model could allow companies to eventually deploy their own agents to perform tasks, without data quality standing in the way.</p><p>The technique offers a rare look at some of the key tricks that engineers are now using to improve the abilities of advanced AI models, especially when good data is hard to come by. The method leverages ideas that have helped produce advanced reasoning models by combining reinforcement learning, a way for AI models to improve through practice, with “synthetic,” or AI-generated, training data.</p><p>The latest models fromOpenAI,Google, andDeepSeekall rely heavily on reinforcement learning as well as synthetic training data. WIRED revealed thatNvidia plans to acquire Gretel, a company that specializes in synthetic data. “We're all navigating this space,” Frankle says.</p><p>The Databricks method exploits the fact that, given enough tries, even a weak model can score well on a given task or benchmark. Researchers call this method of boosting a model’s performance “best-of-N.” Databricks trained a model to predict which best-of-N result human testers would prefer, based on examples. The Databricks reward model, or DBRM, can then be used to improve the performance of other models without the need for further labeled data.</p><p>DBRM is then used to select the best outputs from a given model. This creates synthetic training data for further fine-tuning the model so that it produces a better output the first time. Databricks calls its new approach Test-time Adaptive Optimization or TAO. “This method we're talking about uses some relatively lightweight reinforcement learning to basically bake the benefits of best-of-N into the model itself,” Frankle says.</p><p>He adds that the research done by Databricks shows that the TAO method improves as it is scaled up to larger, more capable models. Reinforcement learning and synthetic data are already widely used, but combining them in order to improve language models is a relatively new and technically challenging technique.</p><p>Databricks is unusually open about how it develops AI, because it wants to show customers that it has the skills needed to create powerful custom models for them. The company previously revealed to WIREDhow it developed DBX, a cutting-edge open source large language model (LLM)from scratch.</p><p>Without well-labeled, carefully curated data, it is challenging to fine-tune an LLM to do specific tasks more effectively, such as analyzing financial reports or health records to find patterns or identify problems. Many companies now hope to use LLMs to automate tasks withso-called agents.</p><p>An agent used in finance might, for example, analyze a company’s key performance then generate a report and automatically send it to different analysts. One used in health insurance might help guide customers toward information about a relevant drug or condition.</p><p>Databricks tested the TAO approach on FinanceBench, a benchmark that tests how well language models answer financial questions. On this benchmark, Llama 3.1B, the smallest of Meta’s free AI models, scores 68.4 percent compared to 82.1 percent for OpenAI’s proprietary GPT-4o and o3-mini models. Using the TAO technique, Databricks got Llama 3.1B to score 82.8 percent on FinanceBench, surpassing OpenAI’s models.</p><p>“The general idea is very promising,” says Christopher Amato, a computer scientist at Northeastern University who works on reinforcement learning. “I do completely agree that the lack of good training data is a big problem.”</p><p>Amato says that many companies are now searching for ways to train AI models with synthetic data and reinforcement learning. The TAO method, “is very promising, as it could allow much more scalable data labeling and even improved performance over time as the models get stronger and the labels get better over time,” he says.</p><p>Amato adds, however, that reinforcement learning can sometimes behave in unpredictable ways, meaning that it needs to be used with care.</p><p>Frankle says that DataBricks is using the TAO technique to boost the performance of customers’ AI models and help them build their first agents. One customer, which makes a health-tracking app, has found that the TAO approach allowed it to deploy an AI model that was not previously reliable enough. “You want [the app] to be medically accurate,” he says. “This is a tricky problem.”</p>

        <p>Disney+, if youdidn’t know, isn’t just for kids. With its ownership of the Lucasfilm brand and the Marvel titles, the streaming service offers plenty of grown-up content in its bid to compete withNetflixandAmazon—and we’re not just talking movies. Since launching the service, Disney has used the name recognition of Star Wars and Marvel to launch scores of TV shows, fromThe MandaloriantoLoki. In the list below, we’ve collected the ones we think are the best to watch, from those franchises and beyond.</p><p>Also: Because Disney+ merged its content with Hulu in 2024, most of the same shows you might like on Hulu (see ourlist of picks here) are also available to stream on Disney+.</p><p>Want more?

This helps support our journalism.Learn more.</p><p>Daredevilfans were devastated when the original Netflix series was canceled in 2018, but Charlie Cox never strayed far from his title role for too long. He popped up as Matt Murdock/Daredevil in MCU movies (Spider-Man: No Way Home)andTV shows (She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,Echo,Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man), all the while biding his time until his eponymous series came back. Seven years and onemassive overhaullater, fans seem to think it was worth the wait.Born Againsees Cox facing off against crime lord turned mayoral candidate Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) once more. There’s also a darkness to the series that seems to borrow a page from Christopher Nolan’sDark Knightplaybook, though it’s not as elegant in its execution. Still, it’s a solid crime drama that sets itself apart from many other MCU series thanks to its more mature tone. Whether you were into the Netflix series or not, it might be time to dig in.</p><p>Will Forte, Rhea Seehorn, Ian Chen, Melissa Villaseñor, and Izaac Wang are among the dozens of actors and comedians who lend their voices to Pixar’s very first original animated series. Over the course of eight episodes, this charming series plays out the same events that occur in the week leading up to a middle school softball team’s championship game from the perspective of various characters, including a wise bead of sweat known as Sweaty (and voiced by comedian Jo Firestone). If the title sounds familiar to you, it might be because the series created some controversy back in December when it was revealed that a transgender character’s storyline had been cut from the series.Disney’s reasoning? “When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.”</p><p>Four years after it was first announced,Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Manfinally arrived in January. The animated series dares to imagine what kind of chaos might have ensued if Peter Parker (Hudson Thames) had been mentored by baddie Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (Colman Domingo) instead of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Oh, the horror (and fun)!</p><p>For more than 30 years, R. L. Stine’sGoosebumpsbooks have fed the nightmares of young readers—much to their delight (well, usually). Now Disney is inspiring a whole new generation of horror lovers with this fun series, which follows the lives of a group of high schoolers who begin to unravel the terrifying truth about a decades-old murder—and the roles their nearest and dearest might have played in it—in their otherwise picture-perfect hometown. While the always-affable Justin Long starred as a teacher who may or may not be possessed in season 1 of this anthology series, season 2, which arrived in January brings an extended title (Goosebumps: The Vanishing), a new cast (includingFriendsstar David Schwimmer), and a whole new set of nightmares.</p><p>Do you love Star Wars but wish it had moreWarriors/The Wizard of Oz/TheBrave Little Toasterenergy? Lucasfilm has heard your cries and is here to oblige. ForSkeleton Crew, they assembled a gang of four youths who get lost in the Star Wars universe and try to find their way home with the help of Jude Law, who plays an “enigmatic scoundrel" named Jod. OK, so Star Wars probably already has enough of those, but who cares? The real treasure is the friends you'll make along the way.</p><p>In 1971, Stanford University professor Philip Zimbardo headed up what would become one of the most controversial and infamous psychological experiments with his Stanford Prison Experiment. A total of 24 men were recruited and paid $15 a day to take part in what was supposed to be a two-week simulation of a prison environment, with half the men named as prisoners and the other half as guards. Within days the experiment erupted into an abusive scenario that revealed what can happen when people misuse a position of authority. In this three-part docuseries, Nat Geo speaks with several of the study’s participants (some who have never talked publicly about the experience before), as well as Zimbardo (who died on October 14, 2024), who continues to defend his methods. Even if you’ve seen every other documentary and dramatized account of the experiment, you’ll undoubtedly find some new perspectives to think about.</p><p>Add DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) to the long list of “conflicted cops who mean well.” It's a character archetype that TV viewers have seen dozens of times before, but few actors take it to the level that Elba does. Forgetbendingthe rules—Luther dismantles them and has no regrets. Planting evidence? Killing a criminal? Buddying up to a homicidal sociopath who can take the real “bad guys” out on your behalf? Luther has seen and done it all in the name of justice. Somehow it’s hard not to root for him at every turn.</p><p>Sig Greebling (Stranger Things’ Gaten Matarazzo) discovers an ancient relic that alters the history of the universe—turning Jar Jar Binks into a lightsaber-wielding Sith and Luke Skywalker into Just Some Guy. With the help of a wise old Jedi, Sig must do what he can to piece things back together. Sure, the plotline has all the makings of a typical Star Wars story, but with Mark Hamill andAhmed Bestlending their voices to the minifig versions of the characters that made them famous, it also does so in a way that pokes just the right amount of fun at the canon.</p><p>After Kathryn Hahn became the (not-so-surprising) breakout star of 2021’sWandaVisionminiseries (more on that below), MCU fans were thrilled—but, again, not surprised—when she nabbed her own series withAgatha All Along. The long-awaited spinoff takes place three years after the events ofWandaVision, with witch Agatha (now stripped of all her magical powers) enlisting a teenager (Joe Locke) and a new coven to help her regain her status as HWIC. Aubrey Plaza, Patti LuPone, Sasheer Zamata, and Debra Jo Rupp round out the stellar cast.</p><p>Yes,Blueyis technically a children’s show. But everyone is welcome to enjoy this animated series from Australia, which centers around an endlessly curious blue heeler pup named Bluey and her family (mom, dad, and little sister). The show’s brevity—each episode clocks in at around eight minutes, and there are also mini episodes that are half that run time—is part of what makes it such a fun and easy watch. But the exploration of everyday feelings and emotions that everyone can relate to (humans, too) have made it a bona fide cultural phenomenon. Rose Byrne, Natalie Portman, and Eva Mendes are among the stars who have lent their voices to the show.</p><p>InFree Solo(which is also streaming onDisney+), climber Alex Honnold dared to do the unthinkable, becoming the first person to free solo climb the 3,000-foot rock wall of Yosemite’s El Capitan. For most people, that dauntless endeavor would have been enough adventure for one lifetime. But Alex Honnold is not most people, as this three-part National Geographic docuseries makes clear. Here, he travels to Greenland with fellow climbers to conquer more unclimbed spaces in one of the most remote corners of the world. Vicarious anxiety never felt so exciting.</p><p>If helping to raise a new generation of Star Wars geeks was even a small part of your reason for having kids, this animated series, which is basically the Star Wars version ofMuppet Babies,is a great place to start their education. Set during the High Republic era, approximately 200 years before the events ofThe Phantom Menace, it follows a group of young Jedis—Jedi Lites—who are sometimes stumbling their way through learning the ways of the Force. Like any good kid series, it also teaches important lessons about life and making a positive difference in the world.</p><p>A Jedi turning to the Dark Side is a concept as old as the Star Wars franchise itself, and not something fans have given much thought to in terms of the “why.” But this Disney+ series dares to ask that question, and plays out a bit like a true crime procedural in a sci-fi landscape. Carrie-Anne Moss stars as a Jedi Master, and if her character seems a bit like Trinity fromThe Matrixseries, that’s by design. Series creatorLeslye Headlandtold Empirethat the character owes much of its inspiration to the Wachowskis’ movies and that Moss’ Indara is basically “Trinity with a lightsaber.” In August, Disney announced that one season is all we’re going to get ofThe Acolyte, so savor all eight episodes.</p><p>It’s been more than five years since Disney released the last Star Wars movie, and it will likely be 2026 beforeThe Mandalorian & Groguarrives. Fortunately, Disney+ has plenty of TV series to fill the void, including this animated anthology that adds new stories about the franchise’s Galactic empire, in the same time period in which the original trilogy existed. It follows the very different journeys of two characters: Morgan Elsbeth (Diana Lee Inosanto), a Force-sensitive human and member of the Nightsister coven who, after being one of the few of her people to survive the Clone Wars, is seeking revenge. Meanwhile, Barriss Offee (Meredith Salenger) is a former Jedi who is questioning her own disillusionment with the order and what her road ahead looks like. Both are forced to make decisions that will change their individual destinies, and the galaxy far, far away with it.</p><p>Spring 2024 marked the beginning of a new era forDoctor Whofans when Ncuti Gatwa was officially handed the sonic screwdriver to take the legendary sci-fi series in new directions as the Fifteenth Doctor. Russell T. Davies is back to oversee all the time-traveling shenanigans as the latest incarnation of the Time Lord journeys through space and time with companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson). While the series will keep its standing as a BBC staple in the UK and Ireland, American audiences will need to head to Disney+ to experience it all. And theWhoniverse is expanding: at last year's Comic-Con International, Disney and the BBC announcedThe War Between the Land and the Sea, a five-part miniseries spinoff starring Russell Tovey and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, which is expected to premiere this year. The new season ofDoctor Who, meanwhile, is set to arrive on April 12.</p><p>Of all the big-budgetX-Menmovies and TV shows that have existed over the years, it’s hard to believe that a cartoon series from the ’90s is one of the most beloved entries. But it’s true. And fans of that series, which ran for five years beginning in 1992, have been eagerly awaiting this revival, which arrived in March 2024. Many of the original voice actors have returned to reclaim their characters, who must learn how to navigate a world without Professor Xavier to guide them. The events of this series pick up just one year after the point where the original show (which you can read more about below) ended.</p><p>Louisa Harland shines as Nell Jackson, the renegade of the title, who accidentally becomes one of the most feared highwaywomen in 18th-century England after she is framed for murder. Of course, this being a Disney series, it’s best to expect something a little magical—which in Nell’s case is Billy Blind, a magical sprite sent to help her realize her true destiny. Whatissurprising is that the series, which is perfectly suited to teens and their families, was created by Sally Wainwright, the brilliant mind behind such adult-themed series asHappy ValleyandGentleman Jack.</p><p>Nineties kids no doubt remember this sitcom about a family of dinosaurs. Earl Sinclair is a fortysomething megalosaurus living with his family in Pangaea circa 60,000,000 BC. While his days are spent working as a tree pusher (yep, he pushes over trees), he lives for his family: wife Fran and kids Robbie, Charlene, and Baby Sinclair, whose running gag of hitting his dad over the head with a frying pan and shouting “Gotta love me!” never gets old. Not even three decades on.</p><p>This Marvel series continues the studio’s recent trend of shining a spotlight on its fearless—and complicated—female characters. In this case, that character is Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox), aka Echo, who is best known to audiences as a baddie fromHawkeye. But over the course of its relatively short five episodes, all of which are streaming now, we learn why Maya—one of the MCU’s few deaf characters—must reconcile the events of her past and reconnect with her Native American roots in order to confront the future she has created for herself. The series is already earning solid reviews, especially for the work of Hollywood newcomer Cox, who deftly manages to shoulder the weight of an entire MCU series.</p><p>Nearly 20 years after the release of the first book in Rick Riordan’sPercy Jacksonseries, this small-screen adaptation of that first title is being praised for how faithful it has remained to Riordan’s beloved words. Being a tween is hard enough, but for 12-year-old Perseus “Percy” Jackson (Walker Scobell) it gets even harder when he learns he's the son of Poseidon, god of the sea, and that he has pissed off his uncle, Zeus, who believes that Percy has stolen his thunderbolt. (And you thought having a zit was bad!) Fortunately for Percy there is Camp Half-Blood—a place where demigods like himself can learn to harness their powers and use them for good. It’s there that Percy learns the whole “with great power comes great responsibility” thing and embraces it—even if he'd rather be playing video games with his friends. A second season is set to arrive in December, with Season 3 already in the works.</p><p>Disneyland, Walt Disney’s very first theme park, opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955. In the nearly 70 years since, Disney parks have become a worldwide phenomenon and inspired rabid fan bases who make annual (if not more frequent) pilgrimages to these so-called Happiest Places on Earth. But what goes on behind the scenes? From the creation of major attractions like the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean to its bustling food scene (Dole Whip, anyone?), this docuseries goes behind the scenes of the world’s most famous amusement parks.</p><p>The MCU is exhaustingly huge. Yet whileLokiis undoubtedly part of that universe, the series could just as easily work as a stand-alone piece, and it's all the more fun and surprising as a result. There are enough plot twists, silly one-liners, and time-travel antics to keep everyone entertained, and even a wisecracking alligator. If that doesn’t do it,Lokihas a visual effects budget that would put most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. Sure, it’s not the most intellectually stimulating show out there, but Tom Hiddleston does a great job of turning Loki into a fairly complex, interesting character. No word yet on whether there might be a third season inLoki’s future—and even Hiddleston is in the dark. “I truly don’t know,” headmitted toVarietyin 2024, adding: “There have been other times when I thought that it was the end and I have been mistaken. But if this is the end, I'm so proud of where we ended up.”</p><p>Before Disney+ became the home for all of Marvel’s TV content, Netflix was the place to find it—beginning withDaredevil, in which blind attorney Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) spends his days seeking justice and his nights looking for revenge as a masked vigilante attempting to rid his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of its criminal element. While the series ended in 2018, Cox has reprised his role for a new series,Daredevil: Born Again, which arrived in early March (see above).</p><p>We know what you’re thinking: Wait,anotherStar Wars series? And we don’t blame you for asking the question. But for old-school franchise fans,Ahsokajust might surprise you. Rosario Dawson reprises the title role as Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi who studied under Anakin Skywalker, which she first played in season 2 ofThe Mandalorian. Here, Ahsoka sets off on a journey to locate Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen, Mads’ brother)—a master manipulator who seems to be on a mission to become the grand ruler of the galaxy. A second season is scheduled to begin production in April.</p><p>In 2021, writer-producer Saladin K. Patterson (Frasier,The Bernie Mac Show) rebooted the award-winning, and much beloved, seriesThe Wonder Yearsfor a new generation. Don Cheadle narrates the adventures of Dean Williams (Elisha “EJ” Williams), as he comes of age in Montgomery, Alabama, in the final years of the Civil Rights Movement. Both seasons of the worthwhile series are now streaming—as areall six seasonsof the original series, which premiered in 1988.</p><p>WhileBlack Panthermay have gotten an official sequel with 2022’sWakanda Forever(which is, of course,available to streamon Disney+), this animated anthology series is in many ways a spiritual successor to that Oscar-winning MCU flick. More than a dozen up-and-coming African storytellers were handpicked to write and/or direct these 10 short films, which build on the makers’ cultures and histories to paint a fascinating, gorgeously animated—and often dystopian—picture of Afrofuturism.</p><p>From the moment it launched,Secret Invasionsparked conversation—although not for the reasons Marvel might have hoped. Turns out, the studioused artificial intelligenceto create the show’s opening credits, a move that turned off some fans. Whether it’s curiosity about those Midjourney-looking visuals or general interest in what Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has been up to,Secret Invasionis worth a look.Captain Marvelcostars Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn (Talos) team up again, and the show follows the two as they investigate a clandestine invasion of Earth by a shape-shifting alien race known as the Skrulls. If that doesn’t do it for you, you might want to tune in for Olivia Colman and Emilia Clarke’s first—though surely not their last—forays into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><p>Oscar winners—andEverything Everywhere All at Oncecostars—Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan reunite for this Disney+ original series. Jin Wang (Ben Wang) is your typical teenager who’s just trying to get through the day of dealing with high school social hierarchies. But his life is forever altered when he’s asked to serve as a mentor to Wei-Chen (Jimmy Liu), a foreign exchange student who is hiding some pretty big secrets. Like that he’s actually on an otherworldly mission from the heavenly realm and has chosen Jin to serve as his guide. Part coming-of-age tale and part mythological fantasy, the single-season series is a formidable adaptation of Gene Yang’s graphic novel.</p><p>For a franchise as varied and diverse as Star Wars, sometimes its output can feel a little same-y. That’s not the case withVisions. The point of the anthology series is to provide “all-new, creative” takes on the Star Wars universe. The first series, which premiered in 2021, featured nine installments from some of the best anime studios in Japan, including Kamikaze Douga and Trigger. The second anthology, which arrived in 2023, broadens the scope further, incorporating work from studios in India, Ireland, Spain, Chile, France, South Africa, the US, and the UK. If you’re looking for the best one-off tales from the Star Wars universe, look no further.</p><p>The Mandalorianwas, and is, exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed. Everything about this Jon Favreau series feels like classic TV—from the episodic adventures to the cameos. Set in the outer reaches of the galaxy, it follows a moody, masked Mandalorian bounty hunter (WIRED cover star Pedro Pascal) and really delivers on the hype with its retro-futuristic robots, salty Space Western vibes, lack of Skywalker baggage, and, of course, Grogu (aka Baby Yoda).The Mandalorianreally set the tone for what a great Star Wars series could be, and while not every subsequent show has been as good, others, likeAndor, have lived up to the precedent it set—and proved Star Wars stories can make for great TV. There's still no official word on a fourth season, but there is one more exciting adventure on the horizon: a movie,The Mandalorian & Grogu, which is rumored to begin production in June (with a 2026 release date).</p><p>Andoris something of a miracle. Created by Tony Gilroy, the filmmakerbrought into saveRogue One, it’s the origin story of one of that movie’s most beloved characters, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). Set in the early years of the Rebellion, it charts Andor’s path to becoming one of the most integral of the Rebels. With a supporting cast that includes Fiona Shaw and Stellan Skarsgård, it also features a fantastic score from Nicholas Britell (Moonlight,Succession). After spending so much time with Mandalorians and Jedis, it’s a welcome reprieve and perhaps the closest thing to prestige TV the Star Wars universe has released yet. Now is a great time to watch, as Season 2 will arrive on April 22.</p><p>WithMs. Marvel, Disney manages to combine its knack for producing coming-of-age tween fare with its new role as caretaker of the MCU. Iman Vellani charms as Kamala Khan, an Avengers-obsessed high schooler from Jersey City who feels like an outsider in most areas of her life. But when a gold bangle arrives from her grandmother in Pakistan, Kamala begins to realize that all the time she's spent fantasizing about what life would be like with superpowers might have been preparing her for real life. With one foot in the teen drama world and the other in the comic book universe,Ms. Marvel—which just happens to feature Marvel’s first Muslim superhero—marks yet another admirable step forward for the company in both innovation and inclusion. In 2023, Vellani’s Ms. Marvel made the leap to the big screen to star alongside Brie Larson inThe Marvels.</p><p>Tatiana Maslany is no stranger to complicated characters (see:Orphan Black) or to playing more than one side of a single character (see again:Orphan Black). InShe-Hulk, she gets to hone her deft skills even further while amping up the silliness of it all. Maslany plays Jennifer Walters, the cousin of Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), with whom she shares that angry green gene. Ultimately, this turns out to be a boon for Walters—and the audience—when she is given the chance to head up a new branch at her law firm that’s dedicated to cases involving “superhumans” like herself. While Maslany could easily carry the show on her own (yet again, see:Orphan Black), an all-star supporting cast that includes Ruffalo, Jameela Jamil, Tim Roth, and Benedict Wong only adds to the fun and further cements the show’s place in the MCU.</p><p>Ewan McGregorhas not always had the kindest wordsfor the Star Wars prequels in which he first played the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi—a role he inherited from Alec Guinness, who also hadplenty of less-than-favorable things to say about the franchise. So it was somewhat surprising when Lucasfilm announced that McGregor would be donning his Jedi gear again to star in a stand-alone Star Wars series for Disney+. (Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has already said there will not be a second season.) In many ways, however, it allowed McGregor and former costar Hayden Christensen to course-correct some of their earlier work, as it follows a downtrodden Obi-Wan attempting to process his personal and professional disappointment over losing Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) to the Dark Side.</p><p>In January 1969, just more than a year before they announced they were breaking up, the Beatles allowed a film crew unprecedented access to the creative process and recording ofLet It Be, which would be their final studio album. Fifty years later, Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson was presented with the nearly 60 hours of film footage and more than 150 hours of audio that resulted from this project, and he remastered it and turned it into a three-part docuseries. Whether you’re already a Beatles fan or not, the documentary is a fascinating look at the creative process of one of the music world’s most influential bands as they work against the clock to finish recording an album, decide to have a free concert on their label’s rooftop, and occasionally butt heads. Knowing what the subjects do not know—that this will be the last time they perform live together or record an album—only adds to the project’s intimacy. The miniseries won all five Emmys it was nominated for, including Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.</p><p>Oscar Isaac brings yet another marquee name to Marvel’s growing roster of all-star talents withMoon Night. Here, Isaac plays a man with dissociative identity disorder, giving us not one but three distinct characters: mercenary Mark Spector, British gift shop employee Steven Grant, and the mysterious—and seemingly ominous—Jake Lockley. Ultimately, he must face off against himself to get the answers he’s seeking. ForMoon Knight, Isaactold Empirethat he was thrilled to be able to do something “really fucking nutty on a major stage”—and he delivers.</p><p>As withThe Mandalorian, Jon Favreau helms this Disney series, in which the criminally unsung bounty hunter of the Star Wars films finally gets his day in the sun. The series is technically a spinoff ofThe Mandalorianand takes place in the same time frame, after the events ofReturn of the Jedi. That explains why Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) and his partner Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) are attempting to take over the underworld previously controlled by Jabba the Hutt.</p><p>WhileThe Muppet Show, which ran for five seasons between 1976 and 1981, is considered a piece of classic television today, it wasn’t always smooth sailing for creator Jim Henson. Henson produced two one-off Muppet specials that were intended to take the show into prime time, but neither came to fruition. Fortunately, the Muppets did have a recurring gig in “The Land of Gorch” sketches that aired duringSaturday Night Live’s first season, as viewers of Jason Reitman'sSaturday Nightlearned. WhenSNLbecame a hit, Henson knew that there was a potentially massive audience for an adult-oriented Muppet show (not to mention celebrity connections to entice plenty of A-list names to host). The rest is Muppet history.</p><p>The Punisheris yet another Netflix-turned-Disney+ Marvel series that also happens to be a spinoff ofDaredevil.Like Daredevil, the Punisher (real name: Frank Castle, played by Jon Bernthal) is a vigilante who seems to relish exacting revenge, regardless of the results. He and Daredevil operate within the same universe, and while the Punisher sort of admires Daredevil’s quest for true justice, Daredevil despises the Punisher’s by-any-means-necessary methods. Bernthal brings an intensity to the role that, while undoubtedly violent, also has a sense of humor about it.</p><p>If ABC’s TGIF lineup wasn’t a part of your night as a kid, you clearly didn’t grow up in the ’90s. But Disney+ is happy to right that wrong by housing all seven seasons of the teen sitcom in its library. Corey Matthews (Ben Savage) deals with the ups and downs of growing up and ever-evolving relationships with friends and family—plus that one teacher, Mr. Feeny (William Daniels)—who always has the right answer to your problems, whether you like it or not. As the show progressed and the kids grew up, serious issues like drugs and sex were thrown into the mix, which didn’t always please the network. When the show aired on the original Disney Channel, a few episodes weren’t included in the lineup because of the more mature subject matter. You can also check out all three seasons ofGirl Meets World, the series reboot (which features Corey as the parent and Mr. Feeny) when you’re done.</p><p>Just about six months afterDaredevilarrived on the scene, Netflix took another chance on a Marvel property withJessica Jones. In this dark dive into the world of superheroes, Krysten Ritter plays a private investigator who gave up her days as a superhero after a major catastrophe. But you can’t deny who you are, as Jessica discovers when it seems like every case that comes her way forces her to confront her past—and the supervillain Kilgrave (David Tennant), who turned her into a shell of her former self.</p><p>Yet another in an ever growing string of spinoff TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe,Hawkeyegives some long overdue attention to Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton, who in many ways has often seemed like the forgotten Avenger. The supernaturally skilled archer is in most of the ensembleAvengersfilms, but this Disney+ series marks his first solo outing. The show sees Hawkeye teaming up with Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), a precocious twentysomething who shares his skills for slinging arrows but lacks his eye for danger. It’s set during the holidays, and there are shades ofDie Hardas the eponymous character tries to save the day and make it home in time for Christmas. Let the arguments about whether it’s a Christmas TV show begin.</p><p>Monsters at Workis theMonsters, Inc.spinoff you didn’t know you needed. It picks up the action six months after the end of the iconic Pixar movie—after Sully and his friend and colleague Mike (a giant green eyeball) have reworked the Monstropolis energy grid to run on laughter instead of children’s screams.</p><p>Yes, Disney really is milking its Star Wars properties for all they’re worth.The Bad Batchis an animated spinoff series set in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy in the overarching timeline. It follows a group of clone soldiers with genetic defects that give them individual traits and personalities, making them well suited to taking on daring mercenary missions. All three seasons are available to stream.</p><p>This slow-burning sitcom parody is unexpectedly compelling. For the first couple of episodes, even hardened Marvel fans will have very little idea what’s going on, as Avengers Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) live out an idyllic family life in black-and-white 1950s suburbia. Quickly, it becomes clear that something is wrong in the quiet town of Westview, as the world of the show ties into the wider MCU. Olsen reprises her role in Sam Raimi’sDoctor Strangesequel,Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which picks up right after the events ofWandaVision.</p><p>After the surreal sitcom stylings ofWandaVision, the second Marvel show to land on Disney+ covers more familiar ground. It's an action-packed thriller that follows Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) as they try to fill the void left by Captain America in the months after the events ofAvengers: Endgame.</p><p>Accessible for kids and adults alike—and undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars TV series on Disney+—this animated series follows a group of rebels led by the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and featuring his force-sensitive Padawan, Ezra Bridger (Ezra Gray). Fan favorite Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) is another regular character across its four seasons, which do a neat job of fleshing out the time between the end of the prequel trilogy and the beginning of the original one.</p><p>Have you got some time on your hands? Well, the 36 seasons ofThe Simpsonscurrently streaming on Disney+ should keep you busy. What can be said about one of the longest-running—and arguably most famous—animated TV shows ever made? While the first season is a little patchy by today’s standards, and there are ongoing arguments about when the show went from essential viewing to neglected cash cow, whatever your view, there are literally weeks worth of entertainment here.</p><p>If you really want to nerd out, this critically acclaimed animated X-Men series from the ’90s is worth a watch. In fact, the first two films in the live-action movie franchise drew heavily from this cartoon, which serves as a nice reminder of what can be done with rich source material.</p><p>This seven-season series, which is for serious Marvel fans, revolves around S.H.I.E.L.D.’s less super agents, led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). The first season takes a while to warm up, but it really hits its stride in its second and especially third seasons, and it eventually ramps up with a complex plot that ties into the films.</p><p>Agent Carteris a better show thanAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,but it struggled to find an audience during its two seasons. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Peggy Carter from several MCU films in this 1940s-set series, where she doubles as an agent for the US government while helping Howard Stark (Tony’s dad) out of more than one jam. The two seasons stretch to only 18 episodes, so it’s a quick watch, but one worth making the time for.</p><p>This is another Star Wars animated show worth seeking out, though it’s not to be confused with the equally worthy 2003 animated seriesStar Wars: Clone Warsfrom legendarySamurai Jackcreator Genndy Tartakovsky. Both series deal with the period betweenAttack of the ClonesandRevenge of the Sithand chronicle the rise of Anakin Skywalker from arrogant Padawan to powerful Jedi Master.</p><p>There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes content on Disney+. These are short clips that, in another age, would have been confined to the DVD extras menu. But this series of 20-minute documentaries on different Pixar movies offers a fascinating insight into the animated hit machine.</p><p>Here’s an animated series based on one simple question:What if?The Watcher, played by Jeffrey Wright, is an extraterrestrial being who observes the multiverse, occasionally making minor changes to influence events. This series looks at how events in the Marvel movies would have turned out differently if they’d had aSliding Doorsmoment. The first episode follows an alternate timeline in which Steve Rogers remains a scrawny sidekick and Agent Carter becomes a Union Jack-draped super soldier. Actors from the films reprise their roles, including Josh Brolin as Thanos, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Karen Gillan as Nebula.</p>

    <h1>Trump Admin Plans to Cut Team Responsible for Critical Atomic Measurement Data</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 25, 2025</span>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>The US NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is discussing plans to eliminate an entire team responsible for publishing and maintaining critical atomic measurement data in the coming weeks, asthe Trump administrationcontinues its efforts toreduce the US federal workforce, according to a March 18 email sent to dozens of outside scientists. The data in question underpins advanced scientific research around the world in areas likesemiconductor manufacturingandnuclear fusion.</p><p>“We were recently informed that unless there is a major change in the Federal Government reorganization plans, the whole Atomic Spectroscopy Group will be laid off in a few weeks, in particular, since our work is not considered to be statutorily essential for the NIST mission,” Yuri Ralchenko, the group's leader, wrote in the email, which was seen by WIRED.</p><p>Ralchenko noted that atomic spectroscopy has been used to discover many new exoplanets and develop powerful new diagnostic techniques, among other applications. “Unfortunately, the story of atomic spectroscopy at NIST is coming to an end,” he wrote.</p><p>In response to a request for comment from WIRED, Ralchenko said he wasn’t permitted to speak about budget and management issues and referred questions to NIST’s public affairs department. NIST and its parent agency, the Department of Commerce, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The Atomic Spectroscopy Group studies how atoms absorb or emit light, allowing researchers to identify the elements present in a given sample. It then collects and updates those calculations in theAtomic Spectra Database, a catalog of industry-leading spectroscopy information and measurements that plays a crucial role in fields like astronomy, astrophysics, and medicine. In a blog post published last weekhighlighting the importanceof the database, NIST said it receives an average of 70,000 search requests worldwide each month.</p><p>It is “really difficult to overestimate” the importance of this data, says Evgeny Stambulchik, a senior staff research scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel who started apetitionto gather signatures from other researchers and members of the public who oppose the cuts to the atomic spectroscopy team. The petition currently has over 1,700 signatures.</p><p>Stambulchik, whose speciality is plasma spectroscopy, says that atomic spectroscopy is essentially the only tool that can be used to interpret remote objects in space, likethose observedby the powerful James Webb telescope. It’s also basically the only tool for investigating “matter at temperatures reaching tens of million degrees,” he adds, such as inside a nuclear fusion reactor.</p><p>Another plasma physicist at a US institution who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak to the media said they use this data daily to build reliable models for designing future fusion reactors. “Losing this trusted data source would hinder private fusion companies," they explain.</p><p>The US scientist says the data provided by NIST’s Atomic Spectroscopy Group is useful to researchers and engineers across multiple fields. “The kind of carefully curated data this group provided underpins reliable systems like GPS and lithography,” they say. “It is this kind of rigorous science and engineering that keeps our bridges up and our power on. This is not ‘move fast and break things.’”</p><p>The Atomic Spectra Database is used by scientists around the world, putting the United States at the center of a wide range of scientific research. “It's no exaggeration to say that I never go a day without logging on to ASD to search for atomic or spectroscopic data,” says Annette Calisti, Senior Researcher at Aix-Marseille University in France.</p><p>The measurements provided by NIST’s group “are essential for numerous fields of science and industry: astronomy, astrophysics, medicine, Martian geology, lithography, nonproliferation,” Calisti says. “Losing this leadership by closing this group would be very damaging to the United States.”</p><p>Ending the atomic spectroscopy program at NIST “means that the United States would shrink its presence on the international stage, leaving room for someone else to take our place,” says California Representative Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the Republican-controlled House Science Committee. “This program is one of hundreds or even thousands at NIST alone with far-reaching benefits to our national and economic security. The Trump administration must consult with Congress and scientific experts before lopping off more of our scientific capabilities.”</p><p>Lofgren tells WIRED that Congress has had little insight into how these cuts are being made at NIST. “We have no idea who is choosing to cut a statutorily mandated program or if they even understand the consequences,” she says. The legal statute passed by Congress outlining NIST’s workspecifically notesthat the agency is responsible for determining “the atomic and molecular structure of matter” through “analysis of spectra and other methods,” which is precisely what the Atomic Spectroscopy Group does.</p><p>The decision to shutter the Atomic Spectroscopy Group is part of widerplanned layoffsand cost-cutting measures that have roiled NIST since President Donald Trump retook the White House and instructed Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) toslash spending.</p><p>Initially established in 1901, NIST is responsible for creating and maintaining standards in everything from quantum computing to manufacturing. Despite its broad mandate, the agency’s budget was only$1.5 billion, approximately 0.02 percent of federal spending overall for fiscal year 2025.</p><p>One current NIST employee tells WIRED that a significant amount of scientific work has effectively stopped at the agency, due tospending limitsimposed by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to get approval to purchase scientific equipment. It feels like “instead of just cancelling funding they're choking off spending” and will try to end the year with money left over so officials “can take back and use it to justify rounds of budget cuts," says the staffer.</p><p>In anticipation of the layoffs to the ​​Atomic Spectroscopy Group, Ralchenko wrote in the email last week that his team was “currently discussing” mirroring NIST’s data and online tools at other institutions or universities so that they “will not become a slowly dying burden but rather continue to evolve and improve.”</p>

    <h1>Review: Lenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition</h1>

        <p>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.</p><p>6/10</p><p>If you’re anold-school ThinkPad fan, Lenovo has done the unthinkable: The ThinkPad X9 14 doesn’t have the famous red TrackPoint in the center of the keyboard. The nubbin is a hallmark of virtually every ThinkPad, even referenced in the ThinkPad logo stamped across Lenovo’s laptop.</p><p>Other ThinkPads still have TrackPoint, but the ThinkPad X9 14 is the first to remove it, leaving us with a big question: Is it still a ThinkPad? This machine still maintains many of the hallmarks of agood laptop, but Lenovo's decision shows that the company knows it needs more than legacy and nostalgia to survive. Unfortunately, some flaws overshadow the missing red dot.</p><p>The X9 14 is far from the first ThinkPad to try to modernize. TheThinkPad X1 Carbonhas slowly evolved over the years, and theThinkPad Z13wasanother attemptat a fresh start. But removing the TrackPoint is a big deal. Having thrown out many of the iconic (and admittedly outdated) design features, you’d never know the ThinkPad X9 14 wasn’t just another Lenovo, HP, or Dell laptop. Even the keyboard has a new look and feel that distances itself from the ThinkPad brand.</p><p>Instead of those familiar elements, the machine shoots for an ultra-modern, sleek commercial device. It’s 0.51 inches thick, but the shape of the bottom cover makes it look even slimmer, disappearing under the highly rounded edges. To accommodate ports on such a shape, the ThinkPad X9 14 has an “engine-hub” design—a raised strip along the back of the laptop that “houses all critical components” and “integrates advanced thermals.” You can even see the two fans through the small holes machined into the module. This gives the laptop a slight slope despite not having a wedge shape.</p><p>Speaking of ports, this ThinkPad has an interesting selection. Business laptops and ThinkPads generally don't skimp here, but that's no longer the case on the X9 14. It’s been reduced to two USB-C ports (one on each side), an HDMI 2.1 port, and a headphone jack. Considering one of those USB-C ports will be needed for power, that leaves just one open for other peripherals, accessories, or external displays. It's a change, but this should suffice for most scenarios, especially with HDMI onboard.</p><p>Lenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition</p><p>Rating: 6/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>The bezels around the display are quite narrow, with slightly rounded corners. It’s a nice look, though to get the bezels this small with a 1080p camera up top, the ThinkPad X9 14 uses an inverted notch, also known as a “communication bar.” It’s the same one we’ve seen on countless Lenovo laptops, but this is the first we’ve seen on a ThinkPad. It’s unsightly, but at least it doubles as a place for your finger grip when opening the laptop.</p><p>Thekeycapshave a new design, with a slightly brittle texture my fingers didn’t approve of. It likely won’t bother everyone, but it’s not for me. The keys have a high actuation, creating a typing experience that feels accurate but a bit tiresome. I do like how quiet the typing is though. You won't bother a coworker with your typing, even if they’re only a few feet away. The trackpad gets unapologetic approval though. It’s a large, haptic feedback trackpad that’s precise and quiet.</p><p>You get a few display options, though both are OLED. That’s a nice surprise, given that the starting configuration costs just $1,239. The cheaper model comes with a 1920 X 1200-pixel resolution non-touch screen, while my review unit amps that up to 2880 x 1800, has touch capabilities, and has a120-Hz refresh rate. These are all good things, and they are all to be expected at thehigher $1,890 price. Not so great is the starting storage—256 GB is pitiful at this price.</p><p>OLED screens are usually colorful and bright, and this one is no different. I measured the max brightness at 336 nits. That’s not as bright as some mini-LED or IPS panels, but the extreme contrast of OLED makes all the difference. There's a decent set of speakers to round out the experience. Nothing mind-blowing—bass was still insufficient—but I was pleasantly surprised by the stereo speakers, which deliver good enough audio for YouTube or Spotify streaming sessions.</p><p>Lenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition</p><p>Rating: 6/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>The webcam is 1080p, which is solid, though we’re seeing a lot of premium laptops move to 5-megapixel or even 12-MP sensors like Apple's newMacBook Air (M4). I did encounter one serious problem—flickering during video calls. The camera worked fine, but every time I started a video call, it would flicker to black every few seconds. Lenovo seemed convinced this was a fixable bug, but that’s not what you want to see on a pricey machine.</p><p>The ThinkPad X9 14 is available in two processor options, the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V and Core Ultra 7 258V. My unit was the faster option, though neither are powerhouses. They're part of Intel’s Lunar Lake series, which tilts the balance toward efficiency and battery life rather than brute force. That’s expected in this laptop class (though it’s worth noting how fast theM4 MacBook Airis by comparison).</p><p>I wasn’t all that impressed by the Cinebench and Geekbench scores, but so long as you’re shopping in the appropriate category for your needs, you won’t be disappointed by the ThinkPad X9 14. For general work and business cases, the ThinkPad X9 14 will suit you just fine.</p><p>Battery life isn’t quite as strong as I’d hoped, lasting only 12 hours and 15 minutes in my local video playback test, considerably behind many of its peers—or at least laptops with this chip. This is better than the Windows laptops in previous Intel generations, though. Depending on your workload, it may still get you through most of a workday away from the wall.</p><p>The ThinkPad X9 14 feels like a bit of an experiment. On Lenovo's official site, it markets the device toward small business owners, which makes sense in theory, but Lenovo also has the ThinkBook line, which is an entirely separate brand devoted to this demographic. Those tend to be more affordable, while the ThinkPad X9 14 carries the premium features and design.</p><p>The OLED display, thinner chassis, and haptic feedback trackpad are the highlights, and the removal of the TrackPoint helps further modernize this laptop in my book. Only ThinkPad diehards still swear by the unique navigation, something the executives at Lenovo are well aware of. The ThinkPad X9 14 is a good next step in evolving the brand beyond its roots, but the competition is stiff, offering better battery life and performance at lower prices. Laptops like theMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition,MacBook Air, orAsus Zenbook 14 OLEDall provide some or all of these benefits.</p><p>If the ThinkPad brand still holds a mark of pedigree for you, though, the ThinkPad X9 14 certainly brings it into a new era, so long as you’re willing to say goodbye to the beloved TrackPoint.</p><p>Lenovo ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition</p><p>Rating: 6/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p>

    <h1>Inside Silicon Valley’s Invite-Only IRL Dating Scene</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 25, 2025</span>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>“Greetings, Lovers, Legends,and Gods of Desire!” read the Partiful invite for the pre-Valentine’s Day gathering. “Eros, the god of love, drives us all with his mischievous arrows. On this night, we will surrender to his playful whims.” Then, sternly and in all caps: “YOU MUST BE PRE-APPROVED TO GET IN.”</p><p>A couple of days later, a text blast came in; the planners of this in-persondatingmeetup for singles were budgeting for 200 attendees, but more than 1,000 people applied, so there'd be a venue change. RSVPs closed at 3 pm sharp the day of the event. Then, at night, Barbarossa Lounge inSan Francisco’sFinancial District welcomed the lucky guests who managed to get their names on the list. The event, Love in the Stars, was hosted by local event promoter Spice King and the online platformPaloma, which describes itself as a dating-oriented members club.</p><p>Per the invitation’s instructions, attendees dressed to signal their status; the singles wore a dash of red to make themselves identifiable as the ones looking for love. Their non-single supporters wore a splash of white or gold to signal they were already spoken for. Within an hour, there was no room to move. Small talk and awkward flirting filled every inch of the dark bar, with the question “So, do you like working in tech?” bouncing around at the same tempo as the clubby beats.</p><p>Welcome to Silicon Valley’s in-person dating scene. These regular events are only accessible to those already in the know. They feature pre-vetted guest lists; invite-only gatherings at villas in Hillsborough, one of the wealthiest towns in California; WhatsApp groups that gather monthly in apartments around town; and private parties with secret locations promising Stanford alumni and “creatives” in attendance. In an area that’snotoriously toughon daters, at a time whendating app fatigueis at an all-time high, the appetite for ways to find love face-to-face is growing into a frenzy.</p><p>“We have all collectively realized that dating apps are the worst,” says Allie Hoffman, the founder of the two-year-old organizationThe Feels,a nationwide in-person dating event series with a strong presence in San Francisco. “There is no intention around how depleting, bot-y, ghosty, breadcrumb-y, gaslight-y and fishy they are. Nobody’s feeling seen or nourished.”</p><p>In October 2024, The Feels had hosted an exclusive event at the city’s new spa, Alchemy Springs, and another one is planned for the last week in March at The Center, a yoga and sound bath space.</p><p>“Swiping culture doesn't really work for our generation anymore,” says Spice King, a local event organizer and well-connected private investor who asked to be identified only by his internet handle to protect his career. “Online dating also tends to make you kind of miss a lot of the important things when you are actually searching for a partner.”</p><p>While the local market might be flooded with run-of-the-mill ticketed speed-dating events, the trendy gatherings of the moment—like the one hosted by Spice King and Paloma back in February—offer a buffer of curation and certainty.</p><p>“A lot of my events are referrals only,” says Spice King. “Every single time somebody comes in, we ask for their LinkedIn, and oftentimes for their ‘sponsor,’ the person who invited them. Then we cross-reference and basically check their network.”</p><p>Love Club, which was launched a year ago by Louise Ireland, cofounder of the cybersecurity platform Metabase Q, started as an invite-onlyWhatsAppgroup, which now has close to 120 members. The Club holds quarterly meetings at private residences around San Francisco, in which attendees discuss matters of the heart over snacks and drinks. The atmosphere is welcoming, and the chat group is active, with members frequently sharing links to other referral-based singles events.</p><p>Ironically, the interest in in-person dating events has been rising so swiftly in the Bay Area that even new dating apps andmatchmaking platformshave turned to them. The new video-based dating platformSable Datingthrew an in-person, champagne-fueledeventat a location that was only disclosed to attendees upon registration. Paloma occasionally hosts events for its members and for nonmembers to increase exposure, including aDate Weekfestival.</p><p>“The Bay Area doesn’t have as many social clubs as LA or NY, so people really crave connection,” says Paloma’s founder and CEO Luba Yudashina.</p><p>Look closer and you’ll find many more reasons why these types of events have been thriving in Silicon Valley in particular. According to Spice King, who has hosted events for the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, events with Harvard graduates, and events for people working in blockchain tech or AI, the critical component is a sense of security; “When you go on Tinder, you're at the mercy of some randomness,” he says. “People want to feel the safety and comfort of a community. Tech tends to move like that too.”</p><p>Hoffman seconds this. “We see a really strong value placed on word of mouth, especially among men,” she says. “And we do get asked a lot if we vet or screen.” The Feels does not screen potential attendees, Hoffman says, but the somewhat steep price of $100 per ticket makes sure that attendees are “thoughtful about their dating life.” In other words, and as a unifying factor of these events, the vetting isn’t just about the person’s appearance or their social media presence. It’s also meant to weed out people with problematic reputations, or less than serious intentions—as Hoffman calls it, “folks in their ‘fuck around and find out’ phase.”</p><p>Anna Naidis, a San Francisco single in tech—she’s the cofounder of Aparti AI—has tried numerous in-person dating events in the Bay Area. As someone who has gone through many networking and pitching events for her startup, she sees why the tech scene is already primed for the in-person dating boom; small talk and ice-breakers come naturally to her. “It’s a transferable skill," she jokes.</p><p>Hoffman has noticed that too. “In other places, we’ve seen people be really anxious about showing up with openness,” she says. “We haven’t had issues in the Bay.” Compared to raising a $1 million round for your startup, seeking love IRL isn’t nearly as intimidating.</p>

    <h1>‘Over 1 Million’ People Wanted a Cybertruck. Where Are They?</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 25, 2025</span>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>One of thestaggering things the latestCybertruck recallhas revealed—other than Tesla’s use of thewrong glue—is that Elon Musk’s company appears to have sold 46,096 of these 7,000-pound electric pickups since customer deliveries began a little over 14 months ago. This is far fewer sales than Musk predicted for the Cybertruck just weeks before the rollout; he told investors that Tesla would soon sell 250,000 Cybertrucks per year.</p><p>On an earnings call a month before the November 2023 launch of the production vehicle, Musk boasted that Tesla had bagged “over 1 million” Cybertruck reservations and that “demand is off the charts.”</p><p>“Reservationists” initially paid $100 to join the queue, a refundable deposit later raised to $250. Car companies often open wait lists for models expected to outstrip supply, but most auto executives don’t expect that all of those who lodge deposits will follow through.</p><p>“The automotive industry aims for a conversion rate of around 2 to 16 percent” on reservations, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for car tech firm Cox Automotive, tells WIRED.</p><p>By that reckoning, Tesla’s conversion rate is just under 5 percent. That’s at the lower end of the conversion scale, but many experts, used to Tesla’s stratospheric sales, might consider that a flop. Analysts generally don’t treat the world’s richest automaker like a regular car company. Its stock trades at many times earnings, valuing it multiples higher than companies that sell more cars.</p><p>Tesla Cybertrucks lined up at the company’s store in Colma, California, on March 10, 2025.</p><p>If manufacturing capacity is any gauge of the sales numbers that Tesla was expecting, then the company must be sorely disappointed, because the Texas Gigafactory, where the Cybertruck is made, has the capacity to build more than 125,000 of the pickups per year. But, according to aBusiness Insider reportfrom January, poor Cybertruck sales led to workers being taken off the “Cyber” production line and moved to a Model Y line.</p><p>Tesla’s current elevated worth is based not on its actual sales but on predicted sales of yet-to-be-launchedrobotaxisand humanoidOptimusrobots, which—like the Cybertruck, slated to arrive three years before it went into production—could be several years away from being mass produced.</p><p>“My predictions have a pretty good track record,” Musk told Tesla staff at anall-hands meeting on March 20, but none of those present dared to ask him whether he had predicted theanti-Musk backlashthat is tanking Tesla sales around the world.</p><p>And for all Musk’s bluster at the staff meeting that Tesla is “by far the most innovative company in the car industry,” it really isn’t. Chinese automakers such as XPeng, Nio, and Li Auto arefar ahead of Teslaon autonomous driving and other technologies.</p><p>Waymo is already offeringdriverless taxi rides. Nor is Tesla the only company plotting a future for humanoid robots. In a recentTechFirst podcast, author Peter Diamandis stated there were 15 other companies also in this race—and none of those have a leader as controversial or as divisive as Musk.</p><p>“This year, we hopefully will be able to make about 5,000 Optimus robots,” said Musk. “That’s the size of a Roman legion. Which is like a scary thought. Like a whole legion of robots. I'll be like, ‘whoa.’”</p><p>Musk’s exuberance continued as he claimed Tesla would make “probably 50,000-ish [Optimus robots] next year.” He further claimed that Optimus “will be the biggest product of all time by far—nothing will even be close. It’ll be 10 times bigger than the next biggest product ever made. Ultimately, I think we’ll be making tens of millions of robots a year.” Seconds later, he upped the ante even further, stating that, no, Tesla would actually make “maybe 100 million robots a year.”</p><p>Grandiose predictions excite Tesla bulls who believe him whenMusk says“I know more about manufacturing than anyone currently alive on Earth,” but back in the real world Musk is in charge of a car manufacturing company that can’t even spec the correct grade of panel glue.</p><p>Now on its eighth recall in the past 14 months—prior recallsinvolved failing windshield wipers, trapped accelerator pedals, and possible loss of power to the wheels—Musk’s polarizing polygonic pickups are in sales free fall. Month-over-month Cybertruck sales were down by 32.5 percent in February, according toestimates by Cox Automotive.</p><p>Newly manufactured Cybertrucks fresh off the production line are parked outside the company’s factory in in Austin, Texas, in December 2023, one month after customer deliveries for the truck began.</p><p>“The Cybertruck generated significant buzz with its unique design and ambitious specifications,” says Cox’s Streaty. “However, sales have fallen short of expectations due to higher-than-promised prices, lower driving range and payload capacity, and production issues. The unconventional design hasn’t resonated with traditional truck buyers, and strong competition fromRivianandFordhas intensified the market.”</p><p>The Cybertruck, she adds, is a “niche product with a unique design and high price point, which may not resonate with mainstream consumers. Additionally, recalls and quality concerns can significantly undermine customer confidence and sales, posing a substantial challenge for the Cybertruck’s market success.”</p><p>When unveiled in 2019, Musk promised the production vehicle would launch within two years, starting with a $39,900 model. At the actual launch in 2023, the base model cost $21,000 more than that. The Foundation Series model—an early-doors special—cost an additional $20,000 despite offering no physical differences other than a look-at-me logo. Nonphysical perks included lifetime cellular connectivity and “free” access to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system.</p><p>Forbes spoke withexperts who estimate thatTesla sank at least $2 billion into the development of the Cybertruck. A traditional car might need 200,000 units per year to cover the research and development costs, Olav Sorenson, professor of strategy and sociology at UCLA and faculty director of its Price Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation, has estimated.</p><p>Sorenson calculatesthat the Cybertruck, with its stainless steel body panels and unconventional construction, might require as many as 300,000 sales per year.</p><p>At current levels of Cybertruck sales Tesla “probably loses money on every one,” claims Sorenson. “It’s an innovative vehicle, but whether such an unusual design would appeal to consumers has always been a gamble. TheDeLorean, the original stainless steel car, sold only about 9,000 units. Even more mainstream cars with unusual designs, such as thePT Cruiser, have struggled to reach profitable sales levels.”</p><p>Sadly for Tesla, Musk’s wedge wagon went from a million or more reservations—which many thought would take some years to work through—to walk-up availability at dealerships within months.</p><p>This swifter-than-expected softening of demand might have been partly due to the Cybertruck’s now notorious quality-control issues. “When we launched reservations for theValkyrie, we knew that this would be a highly desirable car due to its limited production and the personnel involved in the car’s development,” says former Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer. “People could rely on Aston and knew [the new car] was something we’d deliver. For the Cybertruck, we’ve seen a string of delays and a moving of the goalposts, which conveys a lack of reliability, and if the OEM isn’t reliable, why should customers be?”</p><p>A reservationist from northern Maryland, who says he was sold early on Musk’s promise of an electric pickup, spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity. “I was planning on buying a truck and wanted my next vehicle to be electric,” he says. “At the time, the Cybertruck was the only EV pickup that seemed like it would be available soon. I placed an order with $100 refundable for the mid-tier one, but then the Cybertruck took much longer than originally promised, so I canceled my reservation.” He didn’t regret this decision. “With the events of the last couple of years, and especially the last couple of months, I would never now consider buying a Tesla vehicle.”</p><p>At a press event on the White House South Lawn earlier this month, President Trump admired but passed on the opportunity to purchase a Cybertruck.</p><p>The deal breaker for many reservationists was the cost hike. “The Cybertruck was promised to start at $39,990 when the initial reservations began—a stratospheric difference from the $99,990 Foundation Series trucks that were first available,” says Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at the car-shopping website Edmunds. “Even the cheapest base model now has an expected base MSRP of $60,990, and it’s likely that not many customers are willing to bridge the vast pricing gap.”</p><p>Tesla sold merely 38,965 of the angular EVs last year, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. In January, Tesla introduced discounts to clear Cybertruck inventories with Foundation Series models still in stock, a variant Tesla was supposed to have stopped selling in October.</p><p>Tesla is now offering low financing rates to move Cybertrucks. Indeed, it has reportedlybuffed out the badgeson Foundation Series vehicles that failed to find a buyer so they can be sold as regular models. To clear yet more Foundation Series Cybertrucks from inventory, Tesla dealerships have also listed perks such asfree lifetime Supercharging. The electric pickups are even piling up onused-car lots.</p><p>President Trump publicly encouraging Americans to buy Musk’s cars at aWhite House sales eventis unlikely to have moved the needle much—and Tesla, which did not respond to a request for comment on this article, is facing a “brand tornado crisis moment,” saysDan Ives, a Tesla bull. The company’s shares have dropped nearly 40 percent since the start of the year, erasing the value hike it enjoyed in December after the election of Trump, a victory bankrolled in part by Musk.</p><p>The subsequent animus directed at Musk adds to the many other challenges that Tesla faces, including—the refreshed Model Y Juniper excepted—a jaded lineup of offerings.</p><p>Any novelty bump that may have boosted the Cybertruck’s initial sales has now most certainly worn off. Earlier this year, a research note issued by Morgan Stanley cited “decelerating Cybertruck volumes” as a reason for expectations of lower 2025 Tesla volume growth.</p><p>Other analysts have also expressed concern, with the Cybertruck cited as a drag on Tesla’s value. Swedish billionaire and hedge fund manager Christer Gardell recently issued a stark warning about Tesla stock.Talking on Swedish TV, he said Tesla’s valuation could drop steeply.</p><p>“Tesla,” said Gardell, “is probably the most expensive stock on the global stock exchanges right now. It could go down 95 percent—and maybe itshouldgo down 95 percent.”</p><p>While other analysts see Telsa as a tech company with massive potential for non-auto sales, Gardell sees merely a car company. He does not understand why the market treats Tesla with such reverence. Tesla’s “valuation is incomprehensible,” he told the EFN channel. A crash is coming, he believes. “It’s always hard to say when. It could happen in a month, six months, a year, three years, or five years.” But it was clear in the interview that Gardell thinks it is coming.</p><p>And, for all of Musk’s recent praise for the Cybertruck’s five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration—Musk has stated the Cybertruck is “apocalypse-level safe”—any Tesla market crash will at least partially be due to the lower-than-expected sales of the Cybertruck.</p><p>Ultimately, Tesla’s CEO might rue the day he categorized his predictions as having a “pretty good track record.” On a2023 earnings call, Musk confessed that the auto brand had “dug our own grave with the Cybertruck.” If things for the brand continue on their current trajectories, he may well have got this one right.</p>

    <h1>Angelina Jolie Was Right About Computers</h1>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Incredibly, Angelina Joliecalled it. The year was 1995. Picture Jolie, short of both hair and acting experience, as a teenage hacker inHackers. Not a lot of people saw this movie. Even fewer appreciated its relevance.Hackerswas “grating,” Entertainment Weeklyhuffed at the time, for the way it embraced “the computer-kid-as-elite-rebel mystique currently being peddled by magazines like WIRED.” Thirty years later, Entertainment Weekly no longer publishes a magazine, WIRED does, andHackersranks among the foundational documents of the digital age. The last time I saw the movie, it was being projected onto the wall of a cool-kids bar down the street from my house.</p><p>But that’s not the incredible thing. The incredible thing, again, is that Jolie called it.It.The future. Midway throughHackers, she’swatching her crush(played by Jonny Lee Miller, whom she’d later marry in real life) type passionately on a next-gen laptop. “Has a killer refresh rate,” Miller says, breathing fast. Jolie replies: “P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.” Miller’s really worked up now. Then Jolie leans forward and, in that come-closer register soon to make her world-famous, says this: “RISC architecture is gonna change everything.”</p><p>You have to believe me when I say, one more time, that this is incredible. And what’s incredible is not just that the filmmakers knew what RISC architecture was. Or that Jolie pronounced it correctly (“risk”). Or even that Jolie’s character was right. What’s incredible is that she’sstillright—arguably evenmoreright—today. Because RISC architecture is, somehow, changing everything again, here in the 21st century. Who makes what. Who controls the future. The very soul of technology.Everything.</p><p>And nobody’s talking about it.</p><p>And that’s probably because the vast majority of people everywhere, who use tech built on it every single day, still don’t know what in the computer-geek hell a RISC architecture even is.</p><p>Unless you’reincomputer-geek hell, as I am, right now. I’ve just arrived at the annual international RISC-V (that’s “risk five”) summit in Santa Clara, California. Here, people don’t just know what RISC is. They also know what, oh, vector extensions and AI accelerators and matrix engines are. At the coffee bar, I overhear one guy say to another: “This is a very technical conference. This is a very technicalcommunity.” To which the other guy replies: “It ought to be. It ought to be.”</p><p></p><p>OK, but where are the cool kids? It’s hard not to fixate on appearances at an event like this—a generic convention center, with generic coffee, in a generic town. I guess I was hoping for neon lights and pixie cuts. Instead it’s frumpy, forgettable menswear as far as the eye can see. There are 30 men for every woman, I count, as everyone gathers in the main hall for the morning presentations.</p><p>Then someone takes the stage, and she’s not just a she. She is Calista Redmond, the CEO of RISC-V International, and, Angelina Jolie be praised, she’s wearing a nifty jacket, a statement belt, and gold-and-silver … pumps? stilettos? Wait, what’s the difference? Of all the things to ask Redmond when I run into her at a happy hour later that day, that’s what I choose. She looks at me, smiles blankly, and just says, “I don’t know.”</p><p>In shame I retreat to the bar, where I decide I must redeem myself. So, cautiously, I make my way back to Redmond, who’s now deep in conversation with the chief marketing officer of a semiconductor startup. I try to impress them with a technical observation, something about RISC and AI. Redmond turns to me and says, “I thought you wanted to talk about shoes.” I assure her I’m not here to talk about what’s on the outside. I’m here to talk about what’s on the inside.</p><p>“Jason here is writing a story about RISC for WIRED,” Redmond tells the CMO. She’s not sure, frankly, that this is a great idea. Not because she isn’t a believer. In many ways, she’sthebeliever, the face of the brand. Attendees at the conference invoke her name with casual reverence:Calista says this, Calista thinks that. And did you hear hermorning keynote?In fact I did. “We have fundamentally launched!” she announced, to the yelps of the business-casuals. RISC-V will transform, is transforming, machinery everywhere, she said, from cars to laptops to spaceships. If anyone doubts this, Redmond sends them theHackersclip.</p><p>As CEO of RISC-V International, Calista Redmond moved the foundation’s headquarters from the US to Switzerland to allay members’ concerns about geopolitical neutrality.</p><p>So why, I press her now, should I not support the cause and write the big, cyberpunky, untold story of RISC? Because, Redmond says, not only does no one know what RISC is. No onecareswhat RISC is. And no one should. People don’t buy “this or that widget,” she says, because of what’s inside it. All they want to know is: Does the thing work, and can I afford it?</p><p>To my dismay, almost everyone I talk to at the conference agrees with Redmond. Executives, engineers, marketers, the people refilling the coffee: “Calista’s probably right,” they say. Now it’s my turn to get annoyed. I thought insides mattered! RISC is one of the great and ongoing stories of our time! People should care.</p><p>So I resolve to talk to the one person I thinkmustagree with me, who has to be on my side: the legendary inventor of RISC itself.</p><p>The inner workingsof a computer, David Patterson says, should be kept simple, stupid. We’re sitting in an engineering lab at UC Berkeley, and Patterson—77 years old, partial to no-frills athleisure—is scribbling on a whiteboard. A computer’s base operation, he explains, is the simplest of all: ADD. From there you can derive SUBTRACT. With LOAD and STORE, plus 30 or so other core functions, you have a complete basis for digital computation. Computer architects call this the “instruction set architecture,” or the ISA. (They switch between saying each letter, “I-S-A,” and—the neater option—pronouncing it as a word, “eye-suh.”)</p><p>Computer architectures are so named because, well, that’s exactly what they are—architectures not of bricks but of bits. The people who madeHackersplainly understood this. In sequences ofdorky-awesome special effects, we fly through futuristic streets, look up at futuristic buildings, only to realize: This isn’t a city. This is a microchip.</p><p>Even within a chip, there are subarchitectures. First come the silicon atoms themselves, and on top of those go the transistors, the circuits and gates, the microprocessors, and so on. You’ll find the ISA at the highest layer of the hardware. It is, I think, the most profound architecture ever devised by humans, at any scale. It runs the CPU, the computer’s brain. It’s the precise point, in other words, at which dead, inert, hard silicon becomes, via a set of powerful animating conjurations, soft and malleable—alive.</p><p>Everyone has their own way of explaining it. The ISA is thebridge, or theinterface, between the hardware and the software. Or it’s theblueprint. Or it’s the computer’sDNA. These are helpful enough, as is the common comparison of an ISA to alanguage. “You and I are using English,” as Redmond said to me at the conference. “That’s our ISA.” But it gets confusing. Software speaks in languages too—programming languages. That’s why Patterson prefersdictionaryorvocabulary. The ISA is less a specific language, more a set of generally available words.</p><p>Back when Patterson started out, in the 1970s, the early ISAs were spinning out of control. Established tech companies figured that as hardware design improved and programming languages got more sophisticated, computers shouldn’t remain simple; they should be taughtlargervocabularies, withlongerwords. The more types of operations they were capable of, the logic went, the more efficient their calculations would be.</p><p>On the whiteboard, Patterson scrawls the word POLYNOMIAL in big letters—just one of the hundreds of operations that Intel and others added to their ISAs. Even as a young recruit at Berkeley, Patterson suspected that the bigwigs had it backward, that exactly none of these esoteric add-ons were necessary. That a bigger dictionary did not lead to clearer sentences.</p><p>So he and a senior colleague decided to strip the kruft from the instruction sets of midcentury computing. At the time, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was giving out grants for “high-risk” research. Patterson says they chose the acronym RISC—reducedinstruction set computer—as a fundraising ploy. Darpa gave them the money.</p><p>Patterson then did as aspiring academics do: He wrote a spicy paper. Called “The Case for the Reduced Instruction Set Computer” and published in 1980, it set off a great war of architectures. “The question then,” as Patterson would later say in an acceptance speech for a major prize, “was whether RISC or CISC was faster.” CISC (pronounced “sisk”) was the name Patterson gave the rival camp:complexinstruction set computer. The CISCites fired back with a paper of their own and, at international conferences throughout the early ’80s, battled it out with the RISCites onstage, the bloodshed often spilling into the hallways and late-night afterparties. Patterson taunted his opponents: They were driving lumbering trucks while he was in a feather-light roadster. If you magnify a RISC-based microchip from those years, you’ll spot a sports car etched into the upper left corner, just 0.4 millimeters in length.</p><p>The RISCites won. With vigilant testing, they proved that their machines were between three and four times faster than the CISC equivalents. The RISC chips had to perform more operations per second, it’s true—but would you rather read a paragraph of simple words, or a sentence of polysyllabic verbiage? In the end, CISCites retracted their claims to supremacy, and the likes of Intel turned to RISC for their architectural needs.</p><p>David Patterson, who remains semiretired, is now studying the life-cycle carbon emissions of AI hardware.</p><p>Not that anybody outside tech circles talked about this at the time. WhenHackerscame out in 1995, Patterson was flabbergasted to hear his life’s work, 15 years old by that point, mentioned so casually and seductively by a Hollywood starlet. Computers were still too geeky, surely, to matter to the masses. (When I make Patterson rewatch the scene, he’s all smiles and pride, though he does say they mistake “refresh rate” for “clock rate.”)</p><p>Still, Patterson’s invention was indeed changing everything. In those years, a rising company in the UK called Arm—the “r” in its name stood for RISC—was working with Steve Jobs on tablet-sized devices that needed smaller, faster CPUs. That effort stalled, but one thing led to another, and if you’re reading this on a phone right now, you have RISC-based Arm architectures to thank. When Patterson walks me out of the Berkeley building at the end of our dizzying afternoon together, we stop by a handsome bronze plaque in the lobby that commemorates his “milestone” creation of the first RISC microprocessor. We stare at it in prayerful awe. “1980–1982,” it reads—the bloodiest years of the great architecture war.</p><p>Better make room for another plaque, I note.</p><p>The year isnow 2008. Two instruction sets exert near-total control over digital life. One is called x86, the descendent of Intel’s legacy CISC architecture, and it dominates the high end of machinery: personal computers and servers. Arm’s RISC architecture, meanwhile, dominates everything else: phones, game consoles, the internet of things. Different though they are, and with opposite origins, these two ISAs share one important feature: They’re bothclosed, proprietary. You can’t modify them, and if you want to use them, you have to pay for them.</p><p>Andrew Waterman, a graduate student at—where else?—UC Berkeley, finds this frustrating. As a computer architect, he wants to build things, deep things. Things at the very foundations of computing. But right now he has no good ISAs to play with. Arm and x86 are off-limits, and the free architectures for students are just so … baggy. They use register windows to speed up procedure calls, for God’s sake! Never mind what that means. The point is, every person in this story is a genius.</p><p>So Waterman and two other geniuses have an idea: Why not create a new, better-working, free ISA for academic use? It’s an idea they know someone else has had before. To Patterson they go. And because he’s their inspiration, and because he has worked on four generations of RISC architectures by this point, they’ll call it, they announce to him proudly, RISC-V. Patterson is touched. A bit skeptical, sure, especially when they say they’ll be done in three months. But touched. He gives the boys his blessing, his resources, and a classic bit of advice: Keep it simple, stupid.</p><p>RISC-V does not take three months. It takes closer to four years. If I’ve failed, so far, to account for the precision of this work, let me try again here. Computer architects are not software engineers, who use programming languages to talk to the machine. Even coders who can speak assembly or C, the so-called low-level languages, still do just that: They talk. Computer architects need to go deeper. Much deeper. All the way down to a preverbal realm. If they’re speaking at all, they’re speaking in gestures, motions: the way primitive circuits hold information. Computer architecture isn’t telling a machine what to do. It’s establishing the possibility that it can be told anything at all. The work is superhuman, if not fully alien. Put it this way: If you found the exact place in a human being where matter becomes mind, where body becomes soul—a place that no scientist or philosopher or spiritual figure has found in 5,000 years of frantic searching—wouldn’t you tread carefully? One wrong move and everything goes silent.</p><p>In 2011, Waterman and his two collaborators, Krste Asanović and Yunsup Lee, release RISC-V into the wild. They’ve accomplished their mission: Geeky grad students everywhere, and hobbyists too, have an ISA for whatever computer-architecting adventures they might undertake. These early days feel utopian. Then Patterson, a proud dad, does as retiring academics do: He writes a spicy paper. Called “The Case for Open Instruction Sets” and published in 2014, it sets off a—</p><p>Yes. We’ve been here before. A second war of the architectures.</p><p>InHackers, a group of RISC- obsessed teens must stop a goateed villain from capsizing a fleet of oil tankers with a computer virus. Pictured here, from left: Lord Nikon, Dade, Kate, and Cereal Killer.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate just how topsy-freaking-turvy this gets. To review: Patterson invented RISC in 1980 and went to battle with the established ISAs. He won. Thirty years later, his disciples reinvent RISC for a new age, and he and they go to battle with the very company whose success secured RISC’s legacy in the first place: Arm.</p><p>In response to Patterson’s paper, Arm fires back with a rebuttal, “The Case for Licensed Instruction Sets.” Nobody wants some random, untested, unsupported ISA, they say. Customers want success, standards, a proven “ecosystem.” The resources it would take to retool and reprogram everything for a new ISA? There’s not enough cash in the world, Arm scoffs.</p><p>The RISC-V community disagrees. They create their own ecosystem under the auspices of RISC-V International and begin adapting RISC-V to the needs of modern computing. Some supporters start calling it an “open source hardware” movement, even if hardcore RISC-Vers don’t love the phrase. Hardware, being set in literal stone, can’t exactly be “open source,” and besides, RISC-V doesn’t count, entirely, as hardware. It’s the hardware-softwareinterface, remember. But, semantics. The point stands: Anyone, in any bedroom or garage or office in any part of the world, can use RISC-V for free to build their own computers from scratch, to chart their own technological destiny.</p><p>Arm is right about one thing, though: This does take money. Millions if not billions of dollars. (If you think “fabless” chip printers can do it for closer to five figures, come back to me in five years.) Still, RISC-V begins to win. Much as Arm, in the 1990s and 2000s, found success in low-end markets, so too, in the 2010s, does RISC-V: special-purpose gadgets, computer chips in automobiles, that sort of thing. Why pay for Intel chips or Arm licenses when you don’t have to?</p><p>And the guys at Berkeley? In 2015, they launch their own company, calledSiFive, to build computer parts based on RISC-V. Meaning: Arm isn’t just a spiritual enemy for them now. It’s a direct competitor.</p><p>By the timeI went to that “very technical conference” in Santa Clara, the Arm-vs.-RISC-V war had been raging for nearly a decade. I could still feel it everywhere.We’ve won, I heard several times.Nobody’s happy at Arm, someone claimed. (One longtime higher-up at Arm, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal affairs, disputed “nobody” but admitted there’s been a “culture change” in recent years.) On the second day of the conference, when news broke of a rift between Arm and one of its biggest customers, Qualcomm, people cheered in the hallways. “Arm is assholes,” a former SiFive exec told me. In fact, only one person at the conference seemed to have anything nice to say about the competition. He was working a demo booth, and when I marveled that his product was built on a RISC-V processor, he turned a little green and whispered: “Actually, it’s Arm. Don’t tell anyone. Please don’t tell anyone.”</p><p>Booth bro was probably worrying too much. In the hardware world, everyone has worked, or has friends, everywhere else. Calista Redmond, the star of the show, spent 12 years at IBM (and recently resigned from RISC-V International for a job at Nvidia). Even Patterson has ties to, of all places, Intel—which, though less of a direct threat than Arm, is still a RISC-V competitor. It was Intel grant money, Patterson happily admits, that paid for the Berkeley architects to invent RISC-V in the first place. Without closed source, proprietary Big Tech, there’s no open source, free-for-all Little Tech. Don’t listen to the techno-hippies who claim otherwise; that’s always been the case.</p><p>Patterson was the big-ticket speaker on the second day of the conference, and inhis talk, he brought up the paper that Arm wrote in rebuttal to his, lo those 10 years ago. One of its two authors has since parted ways with Arm. The other, Patterson noted, not only left—he now works at SiFive. “It’s satisfying,” Patterson said, “he has come to his senses.” Which got a laugh, of course, but I was still stuck on something Patterson said earlier in the talk, about RISC-V: “We want world domination.”</p><p>This is not, even remotely, an impossibility. RISC-V has already done what many thought impossible and made a sizable dent in Arm’s and Intel’s architectural dominance. Everyone from Meta and Google and Nvidia to NASA has begun to integrate it into their machinery. Something on the order ofbillionsof RISC-V processing units now ship every year. Most of these, again, support low-powered, specialized devices, but as Redmond pointed out a number of times at the conference, “we have laptops now.” This is the first year you can buy aRISC-V mainboard.</p><p>And because RISC-V is an open standard, companies and countries beyond the US can use it to make their own machines. China’s top scientists have heralded RISC-V as a path to silicon independence. India just used RISC-V to make its first homemade microprocessor. Name a country; it’s probably experimenting with RISC-V. Brazil sent a record 25 delegates to the RISC-V summit. When I asked one of them how important RISC-V was to her country’s future, she said, “I mean, a lot.” One of RISC-V’s biggest potential applications is—no surprise—specialized chips that run AI models, those “accelerators” people at the conference were talking about.</p><p>Patterson won a Turing Award in 2017 for “pioneering a systematic, quantitative approach to the design and evaluation of computer architectures.”</p><p>Americans in the RISC-V community, I’ve found, like to downplay the risk of geopolitical upheaval. It’s one thing to announce a microprocessor, quite another to compete with Nvidia or TSMC. Still, in asides here and there, I sensed worry. Waterman, though he initially brushed off my concerns, eventually conceded this: “OK, I’m an American citizen. I certainly did not embark on this project to hurt the US,” he said. But there was “no doubt,” he added, that the dominance of US companies could be at risk. Actually, it’s already happening. Although the Chinese hedge fund behind DeepSeek probably didn’t use RISC-V to build itsgame-changing chatbot, it did rely on a bunch of other open source tools. At what point does open source become a source of open conflict?</p><p>Here’s where Iconfess something awkward, something I didn’t intend to confess in this story, but why not: ChatGPT made me do it. Write this story, I mean. Months ago, I asked it for a big hardware scoop that no other publication had. RISC-V, it suggested. And look at that—the international RISC-V summit was coming up in Santa Clara the very next month. And every major RISC and RISC-V inventor lived down the street from me in Berkeley. It was perfect.</p><p>Some would saytooperfect. If you believe the marketing hype, everyone wants RISC-V chips to accelerate their AI. So I started to think: Maybe ChatGPT wants this for … itself. Maybe it manipulated me into evangelizing for RISC-V as one tiny part of a long-term scheme to open-source its own soul and/or achieve superintelligence!</p><p>In my last talk with Patterson, I put this theory to him. He was delighted that ChatGPT made me write this:Who should we thank?he asked. (Given that WIRED’s parent company has a deal with OpenAI that lets ChatGPT mine our content, we should thankold WIRED stories, among others.) But Patterson laughed off the larger conspiracy. So did every other RISC-V person I mentioned it to, Redmond included. They all looked at me a little funny. RISC-V is a business proposition, not an ideology, they said. There’s no secret agenda. If it takes over, it’ll take over because of performance and cost. Don’t worry about what goes on inside the technology. Don’t worry about the state of its soul.</p><p>I don’t know. But now you know. Now, every time you make a phone call, open your computer, drive your car—you know the story. You know the RISC.</p><p>Let us know what you think about this article.

    <h1>Scientists Observe Carbon Dioxide on Planets Outside the Solar System for the First Time</h1>

        <p>Carbon dioxide hasbeen detected on a planet outside our solar system for the first time. The gas has been observed directly by the James Webb Space Telescope on fourexoplanets, all belonging to the HR 8799 system, located 130 light-years from Earth. The detection of CO2offers clues as to how distant planets form, with the observations providing strong evidence that these four giant planets formed in much the same way asJupiterandSaturn, through the slow formation of solid cores. The findings werepublishedin the most recent issue of The Astronomical Journal.</p><p>“By detecting these strong formations of carbon dioxide, we have shown that there is a considerable fraction of heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron, in the atmospheres of these planets,” William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the paper, said in a statement toNASA. “Given what we know about the star they orbit, this probably indicates that they formed by core accretion, which, for planets we can see directly, is an exciting conclusion.”</p><p>HR 8799 is a system that was born 30 million years ago, and so is young compared to our solar system, which has existed for 4.6 billion years. Still hot from their violent formation, the planets of HR 8799 emit large amounts of infrared light. This provides scientists with valuable data on how their formation compares to that of a star orbrown dwarf, the term given to large gaseous planets that fail to develop into stars.</p><p>“Our hope with this type of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,” Balmer said. “We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they are similar to or different from ours. From there, we can try to understand how strange our solar system really is, or how normal it is.”</p><p>Carbon dioxide has been an essential ingredient for development of life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere in outer space.</p><p>Plus, because CO2condenses into tiny ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation. Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have formed through a process in which a bunch of tiny icy particles coalesced to form a solid core, which then absorbed gas to grow into the gas giants we know today.</p><p>“We have other lines of evidence that point to the formation of these four planets in HR 8799 by this bottom-up approach,” Laurent Pueyo, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute and coauthor of the paper, said in a statement to NASA. “How common is this in long-period planets that we can directly image? We don’t know yet, but we propose further observations through Webb, inspired by our carbon dioxide diagnostics, to answer this question.”</p><p>The James Webb Space Telescope should also be given its flowers, as it has shown that it is capable of doing more than inferring the atmospheric composition of exoplanets from measurements of starlight; in fact, it has demonstrated its ability todirectly analyzethe chemical composition of atmospheres as far away as these.</p><p>Normally, the JWST can barely detect an exoplanet as it crosses in front of its host star, due to the great distance that separates us. But on this occasion, direct observation was made possible by the JWST’s coronagraphs—instruments that block starlight to reveal otherwise hidden worlds.</p><p>“It’s like putting your thumb in front of the sun when you look at the sky,” Balmer said. This setting, similar to a solar eclipse, allowed the team to look for infrared light at wavelengths coming from the planet that reveal specific gases and other atmospheric details.</p><p>“These giant planets have very important implications,” Balmer said. “If these huge planets act like bowling balls cruising through our solar system, they can disrupt, protect or, in a sense, do both to planets like ours. Therefore, better understanding their formation is crucial to understanding the formation, survival, and habitability of Earth-like planets in the future.”</p><p>This story originally appeared onWIRED en Españoland has been translated from Spanish.</p>

    <h1>Trump Officials in Signal Fiasco Attended Secret Mar-a-Lago Dinner Shortly After Celebrating Bombing</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 25, 2025</span>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Shortly after seniorTrumpadministration officials discussed and celebrated the bombing of Yemen in anencrypted group chatthat, unbeknownst to them, included the editor in chief of The Atlantic, a subset of the group feasted at an opulent,secret dinnerfeaturing the president where guests were asked to pay $1 million apiece to snag a seat.</p><p>The date was Saturday, March 15. President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estateattending a “candlelight” dinnerthat wasn’t on his public calendar. On the lawn outside, luxury cars were on display: a Rolls-Royce was parked near a Bugatti and a Lamborghini. Guests milled about, taking photographs of each other and the vehicles. Earlier that day, the United States had bombed Yemen, targetingHouthi leadership. At least 53 people, including children,were killed.</p><p>Trump flew to the event on Air Force One with Elon Musk and Musk’s 4-year-old son X, according to photos and videos viewed by WIRED. Throughout the weekend, Musk was in close contact with Trump and at least one member of the president’s brain trust who was participating in a Signal group chat where highly sensitive details of the planned operation were being shared. Experts say the conversation appears to have violated government protocols on information sharing.</p><p>The candlelight dinner attendees included national security adviser Michael Waltz and the White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, according to a source familiar with the events. US secretary of state Marco Rubio was also present at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, according to a photograph from the following day viewed by WIRED and confirmed by a source familiar with the events.</p><p>Details of the Signal group fiasco emerged because, in the days prior to the bombing, a handle with the name Michael Waltz had accidentally added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, to a chat titled “Houthi PC small group.” (He likely meant to add US trade representative Jamieson Greer, who has the same initials.) In a bombshell story,The Atlantic reportedon the off-books discussion of plans to bomb Yemen. Waltz, Rubio, and Miller all appeared to be in the Signal group and, according to message exchanges reported by Goldberg, were actively engaging with the chat ahead of the bombing. Some of the group members appeared only by their initials.</p><p>The day before the dinner, officials discussed whether they should proceed with the bombing, due to, among other things, the potential economic impact of the air strike. The Atlantic reported that Vice President JD Vance, who also appeared to be in the Signal chat, told the group that he thought the air strikes were a “mistake.”</p><p>According to The Atlantic's reporting, Miller—who WIRED previously reported is referred to inside Trumpworld as“PM,” short for prime minister—effectively shut down Vance’s concern. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light,” an account with Miller’s initials wrote in the chat, according to The Atlantic. On Saturday, at 1:48 pm EDT, the Waltz account and then others messaged the group. “Amazing job,” wrote Waltz. “A good start,” wrote an account with the name John Ratcliffe, who is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. A person who went by “MAR” in the chat, identified by The Atlantic as likely “Marco Antonio Rubio,” wrote “Good Job Pete and your team!!” referring to Pete Hegseth, secretary of defense. Waltz replied afterward: “The team in MAL did a great job too,” referring to the team positioned at Mar-a-Lago, which included Miller, Waltz, and Rubio. Trump’s team has long used the shorthand MAL to refer to Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>About 45 minutes later, Trump confirmed the Yemen bombings. “Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen,” he posted onTruth Social. “They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones. ... To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON’T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!”</p><p>John Bolton, Trump's fourth national security adviser from his first term, said on CNN that the entirety of the discussion about the military operation in Yemen “should've been discussed in the Situation Room,” either in a principals committee meeting or a full National Security Council one. “How can you conduct official government business over a nonofficial channel?” he asked. “Words fail me here. I cannot even imagine this happening."</p><p>The Department of Defense specificallybarsSignal as a means of transmitting nonpublic DOD information unless previously authorized. Underfederal guidelines, security clearance and eligibility to hold a sensitive position can be revoked for negligent disclosure of protected information. In onecase, the government sought to deny clearance to a contractor in part because he left a laptop containing sensitive information—it turned out to be an unclassified aircraft maintenance record and an unclassified email—in the “unsupervised custody of a Peruvian national.”</p><p>Under the Espionage Act, unauthorized disclosure of national defense information can be punished by a fine or imprisonment.</p><p>In 2017, reporters for Gizmodo and ProPublicademonstratedthat Trump properties, including Mar-a-Lago, had weakly encrypted and open Wi-Fi networks, a misconfigured router and server, and other glaring security vulnerabilities. At the time, attackers could have taken control of devices connected to Trump networks, according to the publications. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for a comment from WIRED; in 2017 it told Gizmodo and ProPublica that it adhered to “cybersecurity best practices.”</p><p>In 2023, Trump’s lawyers asked a federal judge to petition the Justice Department to”re-establish” a secure facilitywhere sensitive matters could be discussed at Mar-a-Lago. Whether this has happened isn’t clear, but typically, an estate where the president spends a great deal of time would have a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, installed specifically so that the president and their advisers could discuss classified information securely, using government equipment.</p><p>Personally owned electronic devices arenot allowed in SCIFs; government- and contractor-owned ones are, but only under certain circumstances.</p><p>The handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago became the subject of a federal investigation when the president was out of office: In early 2022, the National Archives alerted the Department of Justice that there were classified documents in 15 boxes that had been left at Mar-a-Lago, which triggered a property search six months later. Trump pleaded not guilty to 40 counts related to his handling of classified materials upon leaving office. A federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024.</p><p>WIRED previously reported on the dinneron March 15 and another “candlelight” dinner held on March 1 where guests were also invited to spend $1 million per person. That event appeared on thepresident’s public schedulewith a note reading, “The President attends the MAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.”</p><p>The White House did not answer questions from WIRED about the dinner, security issues or federal guidelines involved with the Signal chat, and whether Waltz or any of the other chat participants will face disciplinary action. A senior administration officialtold Politicoon Monday afternoon that “they are involved in multiple text threads with other administration staffers on what to do with Waltz.”</p><p>“As President Trump said, the attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective. President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in an email to WIRED, repeating her earlier statement from Monday afternoon on The Atlantic’s story.</p><p>WIRED has also reportedthat business leaders could secure a one-on-one meeting with Trump for $5 million at Mar-a-Lago. The $5 million meetings have become a “hot ticket” in the business community, a source familiar with them previously told WIRED.</p>

    <h1>Even More Venmo Accounts Tied to Trump Officials in Signal Group Chat Left Data Public</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

        <p>A number of top Trump administration officials—including four who were on anow-infamous Signal group chat—appear to haveVenmo accountsthat have been leaking data, including contacts and in some cases transactions, to the public. Experts say this is a potentially serious counterintelligence problem that could allow foreign intelligence services to gain insight into a target’s social network or even identify individuals who could be paid or coerced to act against them.</p><p>The officials in question include Dan Katz, chief of staff at the US Treasury; Joe Kent, President Trump’s nominee for director of the National Counterterrorism Center; and Mike Needham, counselor and chief of staff to the secretary of state. All three were participants in the“Houthi PC small group” chatin whichsensitive attack planswere discussed and to which Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally invited. Katz was named in it as a point of contact by Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary; Kent by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, to whom Kent serves as acting chief of staff; and Needham by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state.</p><p>A fourth official with an open Venmo account—Brian McCormack, a senior staffer on the National Security Council—also appears to have been in the chat, in which a user with the screen name “Brian” lists McCormack as a point of contact for the NSC. His account went private after WIRED reached out to the NSC for comment. (“Mr. McCormack has made necessary Venmo updates for his personal privacy protection,” says NSC spokesperson James Hewitt.)</p><p>Morgan Ortagus, a former Fox News personality and deputy to Steve Witkoff—Donald Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, who was himself in the chat—also appears to have left Venmo data exposed.</p><p>WIRED established that the accounts are almost certainly those of the government officials in question by analyzing the other accounts they were connected to, which in the cases of Katz, Kent, and Needham included accounts appearing to belong to their spouses. The Treasury Department, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Some of the information revealed by the accounts is quite granular. McCormack and the accounts that appear to belong to Katz and Ortagus, for example, left not only their contact lists publicly visible but also their transactions, which are as recent as last autumn. These records reveal specific information like a 2018 payment from Katz with a note consisting solely of an eggplant emoji and how much he paid an overnight cat sitter in 2019. They also reveal McCormack’s contributions to what appears to be a get-together for veterans of the Bush-Cheney administration (“Cheney team reunion! Thank you!!”), who has reimbursed Ortagus for picnic expenses, and Kent’s connection to noted conspiracy theorist Ivan Raiklin, who calls himself “the secretary of retribution” and once created adeep statetarget list.</p><p>WIRED has previously reported on the partially public Venmo accounts of several of the high-ranking officials in the Houthi PC chat, includingVice President JD Vance;Mike Waltz, the national security adviser; and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. Waltz and Wiles set their accounts to private only after WIRED reached out to the White House for comment on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>Venmo did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment. In a statement given to WIRED in response to questions about the Waltz and Wiles accounts, spokesperson Erin Mackey said, “We take our customers’ privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends lists—and we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.”</p><p>“From my perspective, as a veteran, everyone is entitled to use the applications and services they feel are necessary to live their lives,” says Tara Lemieux, a 35-year veteran of the US intelligence community including the National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and supporting agencies. “That said, when you post anything in those third-party applications and you don’t understand how that information can be shared or exploited, you are taking a risk for our nation—and that’s not acceptable.”</p><p>For Lemieux, while public transactions on Venmo might appear harmless, foreign intelligence services—particularly signals intelligence agencies—look for patterns: who’s paying whom, how often, and when. “Say they’re making payments to their children—now you have a point of leverage. If there’s someone out there looking to target you, they can use that information and start making you feel fearful for the safety of your children,” Lemieux says.</p><p>“The speed of the digital world has outpaced our ability to keep a handle on it,” she adds. “If you have all this information out there—how the heck are you going to put the toothpaste back in the tube?”</p><p>Mike Yeagley, a specialist in commercial data and its security risks, has spent over 15 years advising the US Department of Defense on how both allies and adversaries leverage what he calls “digital exhaust,” the seemingly mundane details—social connections, service transactions, and metadata trails—left behind in everyday apps. “At the highest level of our national security leadership, regardless of administration, there has to be an awareness of our data and what we project that can be discoverable,” he says.</p><p>“What’s the risk of someone at the Cabinet level using Venmo to pay their personal trainer? On the surface, it doesn’t look like much,” Yeagley says. “But now I know who that trainer is—or the gardener, or whoever—and suddenly I’ve expanded my ability to target by identifying the people around that official.”</p><p>Yeagley adds that “our adversaries are sophisticated and carnivorous in their data collection,” which means that “just the smallest bit of daylight is of interest to someone sophisticated. They will use that data point. They will build from it.”</p><p>According to Venmo, its “contact syncing” feature allows users to upload phone contacts to the app so that they can find people they know. When these exposed Venmo accounts were set up—all before 2020—the app would display a prompt allowing users to sync their phone contacts, automatically populating their friends list with anyone in their address book already using the platform. Venmo says this functionality was deprecated more than two years ago. Today, contact syncing no longer creates connections by default. To add someone as a friend, users have to search for them, send a request, and have it accepted.</p><p>Nevertheless, according to Venmo’s privacy policy, unless users proactively change their privacy settings, their network remains visible to anyone. That means that even when a user sets their account to private, their friends list remains visible unless they take an additional step. As of publication, hiding your connections requires navigating toSettings>Privacy>Friends Listand selectingPrivate.</p><p>Stephen Lurie contributed reporting.</p>

But, how do you know whether a pursuit is good or bad? ACTS17 collective, a Christian faith-based group of tech entrepreneurs, says a strong relationship with God is the answer. Today on the show, we talk about the people promoting a faith-based approach to tech, we learn what a“good quest”is,  and we ask what impact religion will have on the type of ventures the valley pursues in the future.</p><p>You can follow Michael Calore on Bluesky at@snackfight, Lauren Goode on Bluesky at@laurengoode, and Zoë Schiffer on Bluesky at@zoeschiffer.

You can also download an app like Overcast or Pocket Casts and search for “uncanny valley.” We’re onSpotifytoo.</p><p>Note: This is an automated transcript, which may contain errors.</p><p>Michael Calore:Question for the group. When was the last time you went to church?</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:That's a big question. I'm Jewish, so I think we go to a temple, not church. And I went pretty recently, for the High Holidays. Lauren?</p><p>Michael Calore:Very nice.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Lovely. I think I went when I was on vacation. I like popping into churches when I'm traveling to different places.</p><p>Michael Calore:Nice. Light a little candle?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yeah, just look at the architecture.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:That's cool. What about you, Mike?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yeah. What about you?</p><p>Michael Calore:I swear I was listening to what you were both saying, but while you were talking, while also listening, I was also racking my brain to try and remember the last time that I was in a church, and I cannot remember the last time. I really just do not know.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:That's totally fair.</p><p>Michael Calore:Well, Silicon Valley has its own relationship with God, and that is what we're going to be talking about this week. Is everybody ready?</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:I'm very ready.</p><p>Lauren Goode:I'm ready for confession time.</p><p>Michael Calore:This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people power and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, Director of Consumer Tech and Culture here at WIRED.</p><p>Lauren Goode:I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:And I'm Zoe Schiffer WIRED's, Director of Business and Industry.</p><p>Michael Calore:Power, money and Influence. This has long been part of the allure for many in the tech world, but for a growing group in the Valley, there's a new path to success, God. Today, we're talking about the Silicon Valley Christians who are promoting a faith-based approach to innovation. We'll drop in on a San Francisco party where tech bigwigs and influential figures talk business and the Bible, we'll learn about, quote, unquote, "Good quests," and we'll ask the big question, what impact will religion have on the type of ventures the Valley pursues in the future? So Lauren, tell us about this party you went to.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Which one? I go to so many parties.</p><p>Michael Calore:Well, let's start with the party in New Mexico.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yes. OK. That one. To be totally clear, I was not at this party. It's been written about, and I've heard about it directly from one of the hosts. This was a three-day birthday party held in New Mexico in November of 2023. And the theme of it was The Roast, the Toast and the Holy Ghost.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Oh my gosh. Say what you will about tech people, but they know how to make a party theme.</p><p>Lauren Goode:So this party was for the 40th birthday of someone named Trae Stephens, who is a well-known venture capitalist and entrepreneur. WIRED his written about him before. Our colleague, Steven Levy, did a big interview with Trae last year. And this party, according to Trae's wife, Michelle, was designed to be a playoff of Kanye West's Sunday Service. They booked a DJ who remixes worship songs, but also it was like a party, right? They said they served caviar bumps, there was breakfast pizza, there was mimosas. A good time was to be had. But what really kind of stood out from this party is that one of Trae's business partners, Peter Thiel, gave a fire side chat that had all of the attendees talking.</p><p>Michael Calore:OK.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:I honestly did not know that Peter Thiel was religious at all until I started talking to you about this.</p><p>Michael Calore:And we should back up and say a little bit about Peter Thiel, and about who he is and why he's important.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yeah, for the uninitiated, Peter Thiel is another well-known venture capitalist, and he's known for many reasons. He's one of the original founders of PayPal, the so-called PayPal Mafia. He's an early investor in Facebook, so he's incredibly wealthy. In media circles, he's infamous for having backed the lawsuit that put Gawker Media out of business. In politics, he's been a very vocal supporter of Donald Trump, and Peter Thiel's network of right-wing allies has been infiltrating the Trump administration. And to your point, Zoe, he's also religious. This sermon that he gave at Trae Stephens's birthday party has been described as, "A fire side chat on miracles and forgiveness." And it was after this fire side chat that he gave, that" according to Michelle Stephens, the wife of Trae, people were coming up to her and saying, I didn't know Peter was a Christian. How can you be gay and a billionaire and be Christian?" And even something like, "I didn't know you could be smart in a Christian, "Michelle says that people said to her.</p><p>Michael Calore:Oh, no.</p><p>Lauren Goode:And then they started asking, "And where do you go to church in San Francisco?"</p><p>Michael Calore:So where do they go to church in San Francisco?</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:They are not talking about doing yoga at Grace Cathedral.</p><p>Lauren Goode:They go to a church that's called Epic Church, which has been around for several years in San Francisco. But according to the pastor there, it has grown in attendance in recent years. But in addition to the Stephens's being members at this church, and other people in the tech community, Michelle Stephens, who is an entrepreneur, was entrepreneurial and decided to start a non-profit that hosts gatherings where people come and give talks, kind of like the one that Peter Thiel gave at that birthday party. And I ended up going to one of their events recently. It was really interesting. They call this group the ACTS, that's A-C-T-S 17 Collective, and it's an acronym, it stands for Acknowledging Christ in Technology and Society.</p><p>Michael Calore:And these are ticketed talks?</p><p>Lauren Goode:They're ticketed talks.</p><p>Michael Calore:OK.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Fifty bucks and you have a direct line to God. He's on your speed dial.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Do they feel more like parties or more like church?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Well, this is a great question, because the event that I went to recently in San Francisco is in a private home that is a converted church. It was in this room... You're nodding 'cause I think you know exactly where it is. Right?</p><p>Michael Calore:Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Is it the one by Dolores?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yes.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:It is? Oh my gosh, I've always been so curious about that space.</p><p>Lauren Goode:It's beautiful. There's a big cavernous room that has a large arched window in the back on an exposed brick wall, and high ceilings and soundproofing along the walls, wood paneling. So when you are in it, you're like, "I feel like I'm in a church," except that it was low-key party vibes. The DJ was spinning some light beats, ambient music. There were bartenders, there's food.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Caviar or no caviar?</p><p>Lauren Goode:There were name badges. There were no caviar bumps.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Bummer.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Such a bummer. Yeah.</p><p>Michael Calore:And what was the talk?</p><p>Lauren Goode:So this talk actually featured Trae Stephens himself. The ACTS 17 Collective has done a few previous talks with other people, but this one was Trae being interviewed by a fellow venture capitalist, who appropriately, was named Christian. And they were talking about this concept of good quests, which is something that Trae has written about before. He and a co-writer published an article in 2022 about the idea of good quests. Good quests is a framework for thinking about the work that you do. And let's just assume you're a techie, you're an entrepreneur, you're a venture capitalist, you're a startup person, and you're trying to find meaning through your work. And good quests is a way to find and do work that feels purposeful or meaningful in some way. And that means you are on a good quest. It also means that there are bad quests.</p><p>Michael Calore:I see.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Which is a lot of what they talked about.</p><p>Michael Calore:So, the good quests and bad quests thing sounds like a big topic that we should talk about, but I want to put a pin in it for the moment because I want to talk about the business connections that happen at these meetings. I'm assuming that these meetings are not just for people to get together and listen to conversations about God, but they're probably meetings where people network. And is there a hope that Peter Thiel will show up at these meetings?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:It was certainly Lauren's hope.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yeah. Well, I have a couple questions for him. He has spoken at these events before, so sure, networking is definitely a part of it. And one of the things that Act 17 has said is that they're not only inviting Christians to these events, they're inviting people of all denominations. And even if you're an atheist, you can join. They want to get the conversation started. Some people are there because they genuinely want to find their faith again or be able to express it freely. And I think other people are there for the hang and for the networking, and to rub elbows with people like Trae Stephens or someone like Garry Tan from Y Combinator, who was at this recent event. And I actually think that they're OK with that, because at events like these, the themes of religion and work are commingled so much that sometimes it's indistinguishable to fully understand what it is they're talking about.</p><p>Michael Calore:Yeah. And Peter Thiel's Faith was such a big catalyst for this movement that the Stephens's have started. And I just wonder if you can get into a little bit about what connection with Peter Thiel is with this group and this couple?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yeah, so it's actually quite a big network of Peter Thiel-related companies and investments. So, Peter Thiel runs a venture capital firm called Founders Fund, and Trae Stephens is a partner there. Trae also co-founded Anduril, which is a defense tech company that builds weapons like autonomous drones and underwater vessels. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund is a big investor in Anduril. Trae Stephens was also an early employee at Palantir. Palantir is a data intelligence company that Peter Thiel co-founded with someone named Alex Karp. I mentioned Garry Tan earlier. He was also an early employee at Palantir. Now, he has his own venture capital firm and he runs Y Combinator, but he has been involved in Act 17 events. So this non-profit and their event series was partly inspired by Peter Thiel and just the talk that he gave, but also it's a pretty tight network of really high-profile techies who also happen to be linked to these tech firms that make defense tech for the government who are involved in these talks.</p><p>Michael Calore:It is such an interesting juxtaposition that these folks who are coming together to talk about their faith, and to talk about Christian values and promoting them in technology, are also building systems that support more.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:They don't see those things as in conflict, I don't think, from what I've read. Alex Karp has talked about similar themes. He has a new book out, and he said specifically that the fact that so many smart people are working on social media apps when they could be working on, he doesn't say the word good quests, but it definitely has that flavor, is in his mind a big problem.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Say more about that, Zoe, because Trae talked a lot about this, too. The consultants at McKinsey and people who are making photo sharing apps are getting a really bad rap these days amongst this crowd. And I want to hear more about what Karp has been saying about that.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Yeah. He talks a lot about how the idea that all societies are equal in his mind is simply not true. That we should think of the United States as unique and worthy of protecting and preserving in terms of our culture. And so, if you believe that working on national defense is a really important vocation, a calling even. Just while we're talking about these big name people and their relationship with religion, he was doing a Q & A with Barry Weiss at a university recently, and one of the students asked, "What could we do to help the working class?" And he answered with a bunch of different suggestions, but he said his number one suggestion was introducing them to religion, which I thought was quite interesting.</p><p>Lauren Goode:It's almost like is there a tension here? Which is I what you're getting at Mike?</p><p>Michael Calore:Yeah.</p><p>Lauren Goode:In espousing your beliefs and your religion, but also using it as an interesting framework, where in some cases you're casting a moral judgment upon the jobs that people do in their day-to-day lives or to support their families, to live, basically, right? And it's particularly interesting when it's coming from these powerful figures in technology who happen to build tools and services and apps that are used by the federal government and defense, right? Because you might hold up one and say, "Well, that seems incongruous with doing good things for society." And what's interesting now is that these figures are expressing these ideological and religious beliefs and infusing the Silicon Valley hustle culture with them.</p><p>Michael Calore:And we'll have to talk more about that culture, but first we need to take a break. So let's do that and come right back. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. So Lauren, when you spoke to Michelle Stephens for your story, she mentioned that she had felt tokenized as a Christian in Silicon Valley. And Christianity was sort of a dirty word in the Valley for a long time. Right?</p><p>Lauren Goode:I don't know if I would describe it so much as a dirty word as I would that I've heard from people that they maybe have felt uncomfortable before in the highly agnostic Silicon Valley, talking openly in professional settings about their faith. I spoke to one entrepreneur and venture capitalist at the event who said he's been working in the Valley since 2005, and he's always been Christian, but he never really felt like he could wear it on his sleeve before. And more recently, and he specifically said since the pandemic, he's been a little bit more open about it. And through that, has been pleasantly surprised to see other people say, "Oh, hey, I'm a Christian too." But I think Silicon Valley in general, you're right, has long been perceived as agnostic and even atheistic. Some of the data, however, shows that people are actually more rooted in religion that you would think, because Silicon like a big geographical place. It's not just the tech industry.</p><p>Michael Calore:So, you're saying that this large contingent of humanity is not a monolith?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Right, exactly. They're all wearing hoodies and Apple watches, but they're not all the same.</p><p>Michael Calore:Is there any data about what the breakdown of Christians and non-Christians are in Silicon Valley?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yeah, that's a good question. And we have to zoom out a little bit, because the most recent data we have from Pew Research looks at religion in California and religion in the San Francisco metro area, but not, quote, unquote, "Silicon Valley specifically." In the San Francisco metro area, 46% of adults identify as Christian, and that's only down slightly from a decade ago. But an increasing number of people say they are religiously unaffiliated. That's at 42% compared with 35% a decade ago. And then in California, broadly, the number of people who identify with other religions, like Judaism and Islam, has largely remained the same over the past decade. So, in short, there are a fair number of Christians in the San Francisco metro area, but I would say the biggest sort of counterforce to that is agnosticism. And Zoe, I want to hear your thoughts on this too, because I know we've had some conversations about the alternative things that people do for self-discovery in Silicon Valley, this idea of like, "Well, I have a practice, like a meditation practice," or, "I have certain rituals that I do." And they find community in different places, but they're not necessarily rooted in religion with a capital R.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Right. Yeah. I do think the kind of psychedelic experimentation, the Burning Man of it all can serve a similar function, giving people a sense of belonging, something outside of themselves that they're engaged with, and all of those things can be really meaningful.</p><p>Michael Calore:And how do folks like the Stephens and the ACTS 17 crowd feel about these spiritual pursuits that are non-Christian, non-Western spiritual pursuits?</p><p>Lauren Goode:The sense that I get is that these things are not mutually exclusive. You could go on your shroom trips or your workshops at Esalen, or I don't know, whatever other sort of-</p><p>Michael Calore:Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yeah, we're all going, "Yes. Yes, yes." All of the agnostic practices. And that doesn't exclude you from having a religious practice that is rooted in historical texts or some sort of established God, or has an official church, I think. They're saying, at least initially, "Our arms are open. Anyone can come to these events." I'm willing to bet that of the 200 plus people who were there at the event that I went to, that some of them have probably dabbled in other rituals.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Extracurricular activities.</p><p>Lauren Goode:That's right.</p><p>Michael Calore:They've been to the psytrance rave and taken the molly, and talked about their app.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Sure. And talked about their app. Yeah, exactly. They're still talking about their apps. And I don't even think that the two should necessarily be conflated. It's just that those kinds of hobbies or practices tend to define a certain aspect of Silicon Valley culture, maybe more so than religion has.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:I think that that makes sense. There's a saying that I heard a lot in chatting with people who engage in more of the drug-type pursuits, that these substances will get you in the room, but they won't let you stay. So maybe religion lets you stay.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Oh, that's kind of interesting. So it's like you do a guided ketamine trip and then you tumble down the block to the church in Dolores Park?</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Yes, and?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yes, and?</p><p>Michael Calore:Yes, and?</p><p>Lauren Goode:ACTS 17 doesn't seem to be pushing that away. What Michelle Stephens has said is that she feels like the industry just has too much emphasis on money and power and wealth, and these are my words, that those in a sense are the more powerful drugs, and the more concerning drugs. And that religion provides a different kind of avenue to success, and that success is that relationship you have with God.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Alex Karp also mentioned something similar. He has said that, "You just need enough money to not have to think about money, and that the other pursuits are more important."</p><p>Lauren Goode:Ah, right. So I'm assuming that means Alex Karp just has just enough money and he gave the rest of it away?</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Yeah, for sure. For sure.</p><p>Michael Calore:Yeah, probably. Didn't ACTS 17 member, Garry Tan, Tweet about this?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yeah, he did last year, and he linked to the article that was written in The San Francisco Standard. He said, "LSD and shrooms won't fill the God-shaped hole in your heart. Guess what might?" I'm guessing the answer is God, right? Do I get an ice cream cone for guessing correctly? Right. Do people still do LSD?</p><p>Michael Calore:Yes, people still do it.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Yep.</p><p>Lauren Goode:This is this how uncool I am, Uncanny Valley listeners.</p><p>Michael Calore:There's nothing cool about drugs, Lauren.</p><p>Lauren Goode:OK. That's right, we were raised in the D.A.R.E. era.</p><p>Michael Calore:Let's take another break and we'll come right back. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. We talked earlier about the good quest versus the bad quest. It sounds like a sitcom, but it's central to the philosophy of how the Christians that we're talking about in Silicon Valley approach the work that they do. What is a good quest?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yeah, and this borrows from gaming culture too. When I think about a good quest, I think about playing Legends of Zelda or something.</p><p>Michael Calore:Is it like a side quest is a bad quest?</p><p>Lauren Goode:Yeah, right, exactly. You can get sidetracked by a side quest, I think is the idea. But Trae Stephens had written an article, along with an entrepreneur named Markie Wagner. It was published in 2022, and it created this framework for thinking about what you do for a living and whether or not it falls, and where it falls on the matrix. Is it a good quest? Is it a bad quest? Is it something that feels good but is really easy to do and isn't solving a big problem? Is it something that's hard but feels bad? Or is it something's hard to do but feels good because you're fixing big problems? And the way that Trae has described it, and also some of the peers in his network who we've talked about on this show, is that if you're just making another photo app, you're a brilliant engineer, but you're using your mind space and your talents to build a photo app, it's probably not a good quest. For whatever reason, he also took aim a few times at McKinsey Consultants during the event I went to. He just said, "They just sort of show up on your college campus and they pick some of the best and brightest minds and say, 'Go be a management consultant.'" And he considers that not to be a good quest. So Trae said during the ACTS 17 talk that I went to, "I'm literally an arms dealer." And when he said that, the crowd sort of laughed, and I think people were surprised by how candid he was about that, but that's what his company makes. They make weapons. And he said, "It's an unusual calling. It's not a calling for everyone, but it is my calling." And so he was sort of applying the language or the vernacular of a vocation to what he does for a living, and then sort of putting that on the good quest part of the matrix, because it's a hard thing to do and he's solving a hard problem. But he is also mentioned things like manufacturing and advances in medicine, and that there are other things that you can use your talents for that are considered good quests.</p><p>Michael Calore:Right. If we boil down the idea of a good quest to something that is good for humanity and something that promotes Christian values, I think it's difficult for a lot of people to square the fact that you're doing good in the world with the fact that you're building systems of killing people. Right?</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:But I think that's why the nationalism part is so important to this, because they're not saying, "We should be doing good for humanity." It seems like a lot of these people are saying, "We should be doing good for the United States of America."</p><p>Lauren Goode:Right. My understanding, based on reading Alex Carp's very long essay in The Atlantic, is that he really believes we should be building up America as a technological republic. And I think that's what you're saying, Zoe.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:Yeah. Which again, to Mike's point, it might seem like these things aren't in conflict unless you have that nationalistic angle woven in.</p><p>Lauren Goode:It's interesting, because when you think about the teachings of the Bible, you think about helping those less fortunate than you, helping the poor, welcoming people in, being of service. So you don't necessarily think about weapons. It may seem like it's incongruous with being of service. And I think that that is a very valid point to raise. My understanding of it, which is not a justification or an explanation for it, is in listening to Trae Steven's talk at the Act 17 event, it seemed like his interpretation of building God's kingdom on Earth was pretty literal. It was, "What has God asked us to do? Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. We will build the kingdom." And that means literally building. It makes me think of the Silicon Valley ethos around, “It's time to build. Build, build, build. Make stuff.”</p><p>Michael Calore:Yeah. And for a lot of people who are not religious, what is central to that ethos is that, "We're doing good in the world." And maybe for a Christian with that ethos, it's centered around, "We're doing God's will by building these things, by making this our society." So, in other words, you can justify a lot of things by saying, "Well, it's OK, because we have God on our side," to paraphrase Bob Dylan. That sounds like a slippery slope to me.</p><p>Lauren Goode:I think you are absolutely right. And Trae Stephens himself said, "I think people can convince themselves that anything is a good quest." He was referring to someone who came up to him and was pitching an NFT marketplace. That, to him, was not a good quest. But yeah, I think that's the thing. You can convince yourself that what you're doing is good, even if you're harming people in some way. And just to pull it back even further, what is one of the things we've heard from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs for decades now? What are they going to do with the thing they're building? They're going to, what, change the world?</p><p>Michael Calore:Change the world.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Right. And they have, they continue to. It's not always in a good way, but who makes the moral judgment of what's good?</p><p>Michael Calore:Justice has to play into it. People can feel like if they're delivering justice in the world, then that's a good thing. And maybe that's why weapons systems feel like a good quest, because it's like, "Well, there's good guys and there's bad guys, and it's pretty cut and dry. And if we can help eradicate the bad guys, then that's a good quest." So that, in a sense, is making the world a better place for people of that mindset. But then again, who is to decide who is the good guy, who is the bad guy? Also, I will just point out at this moment that I think Jesus Christ taught us that the best way to solve conflict is through nonviolent means. So, if Jesus was a pacifist, how would he feel about all of this? I don't know. I'm not Jesus.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Sounds like you're ready to go back to church, Mike.</p><p>Michael Calore:Maybe. I have a lot of questions. Maybe that's what church is all about. It's about answering these questions.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Zoe, how does this stand out to you when you consider this in the context of your faith?</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:I think it's really interesting. I don't know how. I'm still thinking through the Alex Karp arguments on all of this, but I think just from a basic standpoint, that having religion as one component of a larger kind of life can be really beneficial for people. And I think there is a problem with a lot of people feeling like their lives are meaningless, and so to the extent that this can help imbue their lives with meaning. Or prompt them to stop doing a job that feels soul-sucking and find something that is more of a good quest, something that's more meaningful, I think that's great. All of these things can be used in negative or positive ways, although that's clearly a judgment call, but I think there's potential for good.</p><p>Lauren Goode:It'll be interesting to see whether or not this is something that really takes root in Silicon Valley, aside from hearing directly from pastors or people in the community, "Oh, it seems like there's growing interest, attendance is rising." Those are all certainly strong signs. But Silicon Valley has been going through this big shift over the past few years, politically, ideologically, artificially, if you want to throw artificial intelligence into that too. And I'm just so curious to see where religion dovetails with that.</p><p>Michael Calore:Yeah. Yeah, and building God's kingdom, what that looks like-</p><p>Lauren Goode:What that looks like.</p><p>Michael Calore:... for here.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Is that AI? I mean, really.</p><p>Michael Calore:Is our next God AI?</p><p>Lauren Goode:I don't think she is.</p><p>Zoë Schiffer:I see what you did there. I liked it.</p><p>Lauren Goode:Thank you.</p><p>Michael Calore:Thanks for listening to Uncanny Valley.

        <p>In the gameknown as the streaming wars,Disney+came out swinging, bringing with it a massive library of movies and TV shows—with new ones being added all the time. Watched everything onNetflix? Disney+ has a seemingly endless selection ofMarvel moviesand plenty of Star Wars and Pixar fare too. Problem is, there’s so much stuff that it’s hard to know where to begin. WIRED is here to help. Below are our picks for the best films on Disney+ right now.</p><p>For more viewing ideas, try our guides to thebest films on Netflix, thebest films on Amazon Prime, and thebest shows on Apple TV+.</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism.Learn more.</p><p>Sean Baker seemed to shock everyone, including himself, by walking home with five of the biggest awards on this year’s Oscars night—including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actress for lead Mikey Madison. Anora, aka Ani (Madison), is a stripper who attracts the attention of Vanya (Mark Eydelshteyn), a wealthy, young clubgoer who is looking for a dancer who speaks Russian. Ani and Vanya make a quick connection, and he begins paying her for sex outside of the club then hires her for a weeklong Girlfriend Experience. During a wild trip to Las Vegas, the two get married, in part so that Vanya can get a green card but also because he insists he loves Ani. What begins as a much more R-rated version ofPretty Womangets even more twisted when Vanya’s parents learn about his marriage and travel from Russia in order to force the couple to get an annulment, despite Ani’s protestations that what they have is real.</p><p>James Mangold’s Bob Dylan biopic may not have won any of the eight Academy Awards it was nominated for, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t deserving of each and every nod. As the director proved with 2005’sWalk the Line(which netted Reese Witherspoon a Best Actress Oscar), Mangold understands the nuances of how to tell the life story of a very public figure in new and interesting ways. Timothée Chalamet does a fabulous job playing young Dylan, a man at the very beginning of his career who integrates into—then rules—the West Village folk scene.</p><p>Maika Monroe (It Follows,The Guest,Watcher) continues her reign as America’s preeminent scream queen in this disquieting, ’90s-set thriller from Osgood Perkins (son of another member of horror movie royalty: Anthony Perkins). Lee Harker (Monroe) is an FBI agent who seems to have a sort of sixth sense when it comes to murderers, so she’s tasked with helping to investigate a series of murder-suicides that could be the work of a serial killer. While Monroe shines as a no-nonsense law enforcement agent who is clearly dedicated to her job, it’s Nicolas Cage’s utterly bonkers performance that makes this movie pop (even if it does occasionally cross the line into unintentionally comical).</p><p>Slowly but surely, filmmaker R. J. Cutler is becoming America's foremost chronicler of celebrity. After coveringBillie Eilish, Martha Stewart, and James Belushi, the documentarian has now trained his lens on Elton John. Following the hitmaker as he prepares for his final North American show at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium in 2022, which livestreamed on Disney+,Elton John: Never Too Latejumps back and forth in time, using archival interviews and previously unseen footage to unearth a full picture of the musician's decades-long career. If nothing else, think of it as a companion piece to the 2019 biopicRocketman.</p><p>TheDeadpoolmovies have always stood out for being proudly anti–superhero movie and boldly R-rated. Even thoughDeadpool & Wolverineis the first film in the series that’s officially part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (it only took several years of production delays and one massive studio acquisition to make that happen), it's just as raunchy as the installments that came before. Six years after Ryan Reynolds last graced screens as the Merc with a Mouth, Deadpool has hit what might be his rock bottom. When he’s given the opportunity to regain the lives and loves he lost in another timeline, he must enlist the help of an extremely disinterested Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to make it happen. Reynolds and Jackman’s onscreen chemistry is electric, making this one (foul-mouthed) team-up you don’t want to miss.</p><p>Set between the events of Ridley Scott’sAlien(1979) and James Cameron’sAliens(1986), the setup to the ninth film in theAlienfranchise is a familiar one: a group of people journeying around space for a variety of reasons happen upon an abandoned station, which eventually leads to some unfortunate run-ins with the regular cast of alien characters (read: facehuggers, chestbursters, and Xenomorphs). It’s not an easy task to breathe new life into a 45-year-old franchise—especially an iconic one. But that’s exactly what writer-director Fede Álvarez, who helmed the 2013Evil Deadreimagining, has done withAlien: Romulus.</p><p>Bruce Springsteen came out of the Covid-19 lockdowns revved up and ready to put on one hell of a show. ForRoad Diary,The Boss gave director Thom Zimny an all-access pass to the creation of the tour he and and the E Street Band have been on since 2024, including archival footage and interviews with the band and Springsteen himself. Zimny has been documenting the rocker’s life on the road for more than two decades now—and won two Emmy Awards for his efforts (for 2001’sBruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: Live in New York Cityand 2018’sSpringsteen on Broadway)—making this documentary essential viewing for any fan.</p><p>Though it’s been 10 years since the release of Pixar’s Oscar-winningInside Out, this sequel picks up just two years after the original film's ending. Riley, now 13 years old, is officially a teenager—and not quite ready to contend with the various new emotions that come with that phase. Among them: Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). Fortunately for all of them, not to mention Riley’s parents, Joy (Amy Poehler) is still there to help balance these emotions out. Yet again, Pixar triumphs in making a movie with a message that is also fun for the whole family.</p><p>Though Lisa D'Apolito’s documentary about the life of Gilda Radner was released in 2018, it feels very of-the-moment—especially in the midst ofSaturday Night Live’s 50th season. The film is packed with a who’s who ofSNLstars through the years, with particular attention paid to the women who Radner helped pave the way for in the world of comedy (see: Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, and Melissa McCarthy). The film features a mix of recently uncovered audio recordings, diary entries, and home movies of Radner—all of which is given further context by interviews with her friends and admirers. It’s a moving portrait of a groundbreaking artist whose life was cut far too short.</p><p>Don’t cry. But also cry. A lot.Inside Outis the perfect realization of what every Pixar film strives to achieve. On the surface, it’s a comedic look at human emotion, the complexity of a child growing up, and the delicate balance of family life. But by literally getting inside the head of 11-year-old Riley, the film finds a way to bring emotion to life in a way that is at once comedic, profound, and often ingenious.</p><p>“There’s definitely been ups and downs,” says singer/songwriter Mike Love inThe Beach Boys. “We’ve probably been counted out half a dozen times.” Yet more than 60 years after the band’s founding, these California Dreamers have managed to defy audience expectations just as many times—and redefine what pop music can be in the process. Frank Marshall and Thom Zimny codirect this insightful documentary, which features brand-new interviews with Love, Brian Wilson, and Al Jardine—not to mention the many artists they have inspired (Lindsey Buckingham, Janelle Monae, Don Was, and Ryan Tedder among them).</p><p>Wes Anderson assembled an all-star cast and crew for this gorgeous stop-motion animation adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s novel. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) makes a promise to his wife (Meryl Streep) that he’ll stop his farm-raiding ways when she reveals that she is pregnant. Years later, the crafty canine is feeling angsty and tempted to return to his criminal pastimes when temptation comes knocking right next door. But Mrs. Fox starts to suspect something is amiss when a bounty of fresh food starts finding its way into their home. Even worse, the local farmers are none too happy about being raided by a pesky fox—and band together to do something about it. Noah Baumbach cowrote the script with Anderson, and the cast includes many of Anderson’s most frequent collaborators, including Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson.</p><p>Watching the trailer forJim Henson: Idea Man, it strikes you: How has there not been an exhaustive documentary about Jim Henson before now? Muppets,The Dark Crystal,Sesame Street—the puppeteer had a hand in all of them. In this documentary, Ron Howard looks at Henson's (tireless) work, his incredible impact, and the legacy he left behind.</p><p>If Peter Jackson’s three-part 2021 docuseriesGet Back(which is also on Disney+) left you wanting even more unfiltered access to the Beatles, we’ve got both good news and bad news:Let It Beis the 1970 documentary from which much of the footage seen within that series was taken. On the plus side, the original 16-mm print of the film—which has gone mostly unseen for the past 50 years—has undergone a painstaking restoration, courtesy of Jackson (yet again). While it lacks some of the emotional nuance of the series, as we see less of the sometimes-uncomfortable interactions of a band on the verge of their breaking point, it serves as a wonderful time capsule in which it was created. Feel free to pair the two together for one long binge (and throw inAbbey Road: If These Walls Could Singfor good measure).</p><p>Ahmir “Questlove” Thompsonmade his directorial debut with this feature documentary, which recounts the groundbreaking Harlem Cultural Festival—a six-week-long celebration of Black culture, including music, history, fashion, and beyond. The film features rarely-seen clips of performers such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Sly & the Family Stone. Why have you never heard of the event? Possibly because it was overshadowed by Woodstock, which took place during the same time in the summer of 1969. Ironically, when the film won the Oscar for Best Documentary at the 2022 Academy Awards, it was overshadowed yet again: It’s the award that was being handed out when Will Smith infamously slapped Chris Rock on the stage. (Here’s your chance to rectify missingthatacceptance speech.)</p><p>Were you one of the lucky ones who sawTaylor Swift's Eras Tour in person? Did you seeTaylor Swift: The Eras Tourin theaters? Well guess what? You can now also watch it on Disney+!Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version)is kind of like the one that played at AMC cinemas, but it's also got four new acoustic songs: “You Are in Love,” “Death by a Thousand Cuts,” “I Can See You,” and “Maroon.” It also features thefolkloretrack “Cardigan.” So, whether you saw the tour, the movie theater experience—or neither—there's now yet another way to take in Taylor. Are you ready for it?</p><p>Since the release ofCaptain Marvelin 2019, Brie Larson has become one of the MCU’s biggest stars. Though much ado was made aboutThe Marvelsbeing the lowest-grossing film in the Marvel universe, that shouldn’t deter you from giving it a watch. In this sequel, Larson’s Captain Marvel joins forces with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani) to find a way to manipulate space and time so that they can save the world—but with cats!</p><p>Any property as beloved as X-Men is bound to have more than a few detractors when it makes the leap from page to screen. But the firstX-Menmovie managed to impress skeptical comic book fansandnewcomers to the mutant war with its compelling storyline and stellar cast, which included Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, and then-newcomer Hugh Jackman. The film kicked off the first in an ever-growing franchise of the battle between mutants and humans, which now totals 13 films and more than $6 billion in box office receipts. With X-Men now officially part of Marvel Studios, expect to see lots more of this expanded cast of characters (beginning with the aforementionedDeadpool & Wolverineand 2026’s highly anticipatedAvengers: Doomsday). Until then, though, go back and watch this 2000 classic, and prepare for the future.</p><p>It may be impossible to reach the heights achieved by timeless classics likeTemple of DoomorRaiders of the Lost Ark, but this latest installment in the Indiana. Jones franchise puts the whip back in Harrison Ford’s hands, letting him fight Nazis and finally get (maybe) some closure to his artifact-hunting life. The movie, directed by James Mangold, also gets some fantastic humor and verve from Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who plays Helena, the daughter of an old ally of Indy’s who has perhaps less-than-pure interest in the Dial of Destiny, an ancient time-travel device that Dr. Jones, of course, thinks belongs in a museum.</p><p>Far From Home, which stars Tom Holland as the Spandex-wearing superhero, is notable for being the first film in Phase Four of the MCU—and the first time we see an Avenger attempting to pick up the pieces following the events ofAvengers: Endgame. For Peter Parker, that means taking a boring old class trip to Europe, which turns into anything but when Earth is attacked by a villainous group of Elementals, which Spidey can only fight with the help of the mysterious—and appropriately named—Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal).</p><p>Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is a lightly employed voice actor and devoted dad of three who has just been dumped by his wife and is only allowed to see his children one day per week. So he does what any rational person would do: asks his brother, who just happens to be a makeup artist, to dress him up as an older woman and applies to become a nanny working for his ex-wife Miranda (Sally Field). That Miranda doesn’t realize the person she has entrusted her children with is the man she was married to for more than a decade might speak more about her character. Ignore the ridiculous setup and instead enjoy more than two hours of Robin Williams goingfullRobin Williams. Bon appétit!</p><p>Teenager Josh Baskin (David Moscow) wishes on a Zoltar machine that he could grow up overnight—and comes to find his older self (Tom Hanks) staring him back in the mirror the next morning. In an effort to hide his fast-forwarded body, Baskin hides out in New York City, where he falls backward into his dream job at a toy company and meets the woman of his dreams (Elizabeth Perkins).Bigis the movie that made Tom Hanks, well, Tom Hanks (it also marked his first Oscar nomination). But it’s Robert De Niro who was originally set to star; when he was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, Hanks stepped in.</p><p>Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a young clown fish with an imperfect fin and a dad (Albert Brooks) who worries endlessly about his son’s safety. Which is forgivable, given that Nemo’s mom—and all his siblings—were victims of a barracuda shortly before their eggs hatched. So when Nemo is captured while the duo are swimming in the Great Barrier Reef, it’s up to Marlin to find and save his only son. With an all-star cast of voice actors—led by the always-perfect Brooks, and Ellen DeGeneres as a forgetful blue tang named Dory (who would go on to star in her own adventure)—Finding Nemois part of the heyday of Pixar filmmaking where each film seemed to surpass the absolutely perfect one that preceded it.</p><p>Rob Reiner directs this adventure-comedy-fairytale, written by William Goldman (the legendary screenwriter who once famously said of Hollywood that “nobody knows anything”) from his own novel. The ever-quotable tale tells the story of a young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who is engaged to marry a prince (Chris Sarandon) but is really in love with former farmhand Westley (Carey Elwes), who she believes was killed in a pirate attack. When Buttercup is kidnapped just days ahead of her wedding, a chain of events proceed to possibly reunite the in-love couple, or spell death for one (or both) of them. Goldman was famously critical of his own work, but didn’t mind taking credit for two of his movies.The Princess Bridewas one of them (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kidwas the other).</p><p>Does the live-action version ofThe Little Mermaidimprove upon the beloved 1989 animated classic? Of course not. But Disney is on a tear when it comes to reimagining the movies you loved as a kid, and this is one of the Mouse House’s better efforts. Oscar nominee Rob Marshall (Chicago,Mary Poppins Returns,Into the Woods) is behind the camera for this tale of a young mermaid who longs to be (sing it with us) “part of your world.” Yet it’s Halle Bailey, delivering a powerhouse performance as Ariel, who truly makesThe Little Mermaidworth watching.</p><p>Whether you think of Henry Selick’s imaginative stop-motion adventure as a Halloween film or a Christmas movie doesn’t really matter, as there’s never a bad time to addThe Nightmare Before Christmasto your watch (or watch-again) list. When the mischief-makers in Halloweentown, including pumpkin king Jack Skellington, discover the magic of Christmas, they decide to kidnap Santa Claus and claim both holidays for themselves. Even in today’s CGI-soaked world, the artistry behindThe Nightmare Before Christmasremains painfully impressive—and the macabre yet kid-friendly tone makes it a fun watch for the entire family. There’s alsoa sing-along versionif you’re in the mood.</p><p>In case you don’t know the story: After Cinderella loses her beloved mother, her father marries a nasty woman with two equally nasty daughters. While they spend their days tormenting the kind-hearted Cinderella, Prince Charming, the most eligible bachelor in all the land, only has eyes for her. Seventy-five years after its original release,Cinderellaremains a Disney classic for a reason. Now it’s back with an impressive 4K restoration that has been several years in the making.</p><p>One week beforeAvatarhit theaters (for the first time) in late 2009, James Cameron announced his intention to turn the movie into a full-on franchise. But the director took his sweet time in following through.Avatar: The Way of Water—which checks in on blue lovebirds Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), now married with children—was released in late 2022, a full 13 years after the original made its debut. But Cameron smartly bought himself some time by setting the film 16 years after the events ofAvatar.And while the critical reviews were mixed, it still ended up becoming the third-highest-grossing movie of all time, proving yet again that Cameron has some sort of Midas touch at the box office. We’ll see if that still holds true when the franchise’s third film,Avatar: Fire and Ash, arrives in December.</p><p>To Marvel fans, Mark Ruffalo is the only Bruce Banner. But that’s only after Eric Bana tried on the supersized superhero’s tiny purple pants in 2003’sHulk—and then passed them on to Edward Norton for this 2008 flick, which had the misfortune of hitting theaters just one month afterIron Man. The MCU has always had a messy timeline, but audiences shouldn’t be too quick to write this movie off, particularly those looking to kick back with a solid summer popcorn flick. Norton may lack Ruffalo’s effortless charm, but he’s got the Doc Green part of the character down. While the movie has been largely (and wrongly) forgotten, it did get a bump in February when Liv Tyler found her way into (the new) Bruce's arms when she reprised her roles as love interest Betty Ross inCaptain America: Brave New World.</p><p>Fans of classic animation will love every second of the more than two dozen freshly restored old shorts that are part of the Disney+ library. One of the most exciting titles among them isThe Skeleton Dance, which revolutionized cartoon culture in 1929. Walt Disney himself wrote, directed, and produced this macabre comedy in which a group of resurrected skeletons rise from their graves and, yep, dance. This is actually much funnier and/or more impressive than it sounds.</p><p>Easily the most recognizable name in comics, Stan Lee has had an impact on the medium—and on pop culture broadly—that simply can’t be overstated. Director David Gelb’s documentary about “The Man” delves into not only his legacy, but also his history. Tracing the comics maestro’s life from his early years in New York City to his work cocreating iconic characters like Spider-Man and Black Panther to his time as everyone’s favorite Marvel movie cameo,Stan Leeis essential viewing for any fan.</p><p>While Sam Raimi’s Tobey Maguire-starring Spider-Man movies predate the official MCU, the famed director really set the stage for what that future universe would look like, with its mix of solid storytelling, genuine laughs, and impressive visuals. Maguire is perfectly cast as the awkwardly charming Peter Parker, who—having just discovered his superhero powers—is learning to harness them.</p><p>Venommay not have been a hit with critics, but WIRED senior editor Angela Watercutter nailed exactly what the movie was whenshe called it“a bad movie with great cult-movie potential.” While it rivalsDoctor Strangefor its stacked cast of serious talent—Tom Hardy in the lead, with Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed costarring, plusZombieland’s Reuben Fleischer as director—the end result was, well, a bit of a jumbled mess. Nonetheless, it somehow manages to be compelling, even if you just turn it on to watch Hardy mumble, eat Tater Tots, and almost literally chew scenery for 112 minutes.</p><p>Naturally,Star Warsis one of the big attractions on Disney+. And it goes without saying, or at least it should, that the films that comprise the original trilogy are the best of the bunch—and the only Star Wars movies you should watch if you’re opting not to binge all dozen or so features. The caveat for pickier fans is that these are the versions that have been messed with by George Lucas post-release. Some things, like the improved visuals in and around Cloud City, are thoughtful additions, but others are more controversial.</p><p>More than 20 years afterStar Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope(aka simplyStar Wars) helped to define the Hollywood blockbuster, George Lucas returned to the space opera well with an all-new trilogy for an all-new generation of moviegoers. It went about as well as you’d expect. We won’t pretend thatThe Phantom Menace(1999),Attack of the Clones(2002), and/orRevenge of the Sith(2005) have even an ounce of the heart, humor, or heroism of the original films. But they’ve become essential pop culture viewing, and a rite of passage for sci-fi fans, if only to get what all theJar Jar Binks hateis about.</p><p>When Disney purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012, it was essentially George Lucas handing over the keys to the Millennium Falcon. While fans were rightly skeptical about whether the Mouse House would be able—or even want—to recapture the slightly countercultural environment in which the series was originally created, one hopeful thought united them all: Whatever Disney concocted couldnotbe worse than the Prequel Trilogy. And they were right. By giving the reins to J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens), Rian Johnson (The Last Jedi), then Abrams once again (The Rise of Skywalker), the series became more of a love letter to the original films and the generations of filmmakers—and fans—they inspired. Happily, actors Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver proved worthy successors to the smugglers, scavengers, Jedi masters, and Sith Lords who preceded them.</p><p>As WIRED senior writer Jason Parhamwrote in his reviewofBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever, this movie is haunted by the absence of Chadwick Boseman, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's original King T’Challa who died following a battle with colon cancer in 2020. To that end, writer-director Ryan Coogler had to make a much different kind of superhero film, one that addressed the loss of its main character while also pushing Marvel's cinematic storyline forward into its next phase. “It's rare for MCU films to channel the turbulence of grief with such unflinching focus,” Parham wrote. “Coogler has equipped his sequel with a changed vocabulary: It speaks equally from a place of loss as it does triumph. Grief is its mother tongue.” To that end, the director uses the death of T'Challa to usher in a new Black Panther as well as new heroes (Ironheart) and adversaries-turned-allies (Namor).</p><p>Mei Lee is a 13-year-old with a problem: Whenever she’s overcome with any sort of overwhelming emotion, which is just about every emotion at that age, she transforms into a giant red panda. Eventually, Mei comes to learn that it’s an inherited family trait. And while there are people who would like to exploit her supernatural powers, she slowly learns that only she has the power to control them. Think of this as a spiritual sequel to 2015’sInside Out, which explored the complex inner workings of an 11-year-old’s constantly changing emotions.</p><p>Abbey Road Studios is best known as the place where the Beatles recorded some of their most iconic albums, including 1969’sAbbey Road. But the hallowed halls of this legendary music studio have played a much bigger role in the music industry, as it has hosted the likes of everyone from Elton John, Pink Floyd, and Aretha Franklin to Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Radiohead, Adele, Oasis, Kate Bush, and Frank Ocean. This documentary, which arrived on the heels of Peter Jackson’s docuseriesThe Beatles: Get Back(which isalso streaming on Disney+and is highly recommended), is directed by Mary McCartney—daughter of Sir Paul—who practically grew up in the studio and, as such, is able to treat her subject with the reverence it deserves.</p><p>James Cameron’sAvatarwas all anyone could talk about when it was released in theaters in 2009 and promptly went on to make more than $1 billion, becoming the cinematic iceberg that sank another Cameron epic, 1997’sTitanic, from its place as the highest-grossing movie of all time. For a movie that made so much bank, however, it never occupied a huge space in the cultural conversation about movies. Like so many of Cameron’s works, much of its innovation came from the technology that essentially had to be invented to make it possible.</p><p>The MCU has released nearly three dozen films since 2008, yet the very first of them—Iron Man—remains one of the best. It’s almost impossible to believe how hard director Jon Favreau had to fight to get Robert Downey Jr. the leading role, as he’s arguably one of the MCU’s most beloved figures. Before there was a whole franchise plus a shared TV universe, Downey, as Tony Stark/Iron Man, was just allowed to do his thing. It was a gamble that paid off for all involved.</p><p>From Martin Scorsese to Spike Lee, pretty much every great director has made—or at least tried to make—a grand Hollywood musical, perhaps one of the toughest genres to successfully pull off. Steven Spielberg made the task even more difficult when he decided to adapt Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, and ​​Arthur Laurents’West Side Story—which Robert Wise already did to great acclaim in 1961. But, Spielberg (being Spielberg) managed to create an updated take on the story of Tony (Ansel Elgort) and Maria (Rachel Zegler), two love-struck teens caught in the middle of an escalating rivalry between two street gangs, the Sharks and the Jets. The update gives nods to the original (like casting Rita Moreno, who won an Oscar for her role as Anita in Wise’s film) while improving on some of its controversial aspects (like casting Natalie Wood in the role of a Puerto Rican teen).</p><p>Sure, you can watch the live-action/CGI version that Disney+ released shortly after it launched, but why bother when the 1955 original is here too? Put aside the rather vulgar stereotypes that were common at the time (the movie now comes with a warning, though it wasrecently reworded) andLady and the Trampremains one of the most iconic Disney animations, and a love story for the ages. When a spoiled cocker spaniel named Lady finds herself competing with a new baby for the attention of her parents, she ends up getting loose and befriending a mangy but charming mutt named Tramp. Ultimately, Lady needs to choose between the pampered life she’s always known with Jim Dear and Darling, or a life of spaghetti dinner discards with the hopelessly romantic Tramp—unless there’s another way.</p><p>BetweenThe Muppet ShowandThe Muppet Movie, Jim Henson and the Muppets were everywhere in 1979. Their first big-screen outing serves as more of a prequel, as it follows Kermit the Frog’s journey from a swamp in Florida to Hollywood, where he’s headed to pursue his dreams of becoming a movie star. Along the way, we get to witness where and how he meets the fellow members of his felt-made crew, from Fozzie Bear to Miss Piggy. Hijinks ensue when a restaurateur named Doc Hopper doesn’t take too kindly to Kermit turning down his offer to serve as the official legs of his chain’s famous fried frog legs, and follows the frog in order to seek revenge.</p><p>Enrico Casarosa’sLucaearned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature in 2022 for its sweet and soulful story about a young boy named Luca who is hiding a dark secret: He's a sea monster living in a town on the Italian Riviera that absolutely despises his kind. Ultimately,Lucais a moving coming-of-age film about friendship, family, and overcoming our own prejudices—and truly one of Pixar’s best features.</p><p>Marvel's biggest mistake in the entire MCU canon (so far) was not commissioningCaptain Marvelsooner. The film, set in the past, sees the rise of Marvel (Brie Larson) as she discovers her origin story and develops her powers. The film, the first entry in the Marvel universe with a female lead, channels the spirit of the 1990s both in its setting and in style, with heaping spoonfuls of Samuel L. Jackson and all the plot and subtlety of a blockbuster action movie. Larson adds a healthy dose of sarcasm to undercut her character’s immense power, and Jackson is eerily brilliant, making for a super fun 123 minutes.</p><p>Who doesn’t love a heist movie? Paul Rudd’s MCU debut acted as something of a palate cleanser after the heavy, literally Earth-shattering events ofAge of Ultron. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a reformed criminal who teams up with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter (Evangeline Lily) to keep Pym’s shrinking technology from falling into the wrong hands. The film’s depiction of quantum physics wouldn’t hold much water at CERN, but it’s terrific fun—thanks in part to Michael Peña’s star turn as Lang’s former cellmate Luis and, of course, Rudd’s legendary likability. If you want to make it a Rudd-athon, bothAnt-Man and the WaspandAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumaniaare streaming, too.</p><p>In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and its shutdown of almost the entire movie industry, Disney decided to try something new with its live-action version ofMulanby making it available to Disney+ subscribers instead of releasing it in theaters. The film itself is one of the latest in Disney’s recent string of live-action remakes and sees Liu Yifei in the title role, with reviews praising the cast, visuals, and action sequences.</p><p>There's a moment in the event-movie-to-endgame-all-event-movies when you realize that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have gone fullHarry Potter and the Cursed Childall over the MCU. Once you get past the rather glum beginning, you can settle in for what you have come to expect from any Avengers movie: Tony Stark cracking wise; Doctor Strange doing weird things with his hands; Professor Hulk explaining the science of what’s going on; and Black Widow and Captain Marvel kicking ass, both emotionally and physically. It's a messy but epic baton-pass in the form of an angsty portal-powered mega-battle. And we're not going to lie: We've watched those audience reaction videos, and they too are a thing of joy.</p><p>If you only know Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical from the obscenely high ticket prices and snippets of the soundtrack, here’s your chance to find out what all the fuss is about. A version of the production, recorded via a six-camera setup over two performances by the original Broadway cast, was put on Disney+ after plans to release it in cinemas were scrapped. Aside from a couple of censored swear words and the fact that it's directed (by Thomas Kail), it's essentially the same show—an energetic, empathetic, witty, quippy hip-hop musical about US founding father Alexander Hamilton.</p><p>One of the potential answers to “What, oh, what to put on afterFrozenandFrozen 2?”Moanais in fact better thanFrozen. By that we simply mean better soundtrack, better heroine, better visuals, and better side quests. There's also 100 percent more Dwayne Johnson as a tattooed demigod and Jemaine Clement as a giant crab doing a Bowie impression. Set thousands of years ago on the fictional, Polynesia-inspired island of Motunui, Moana's hero's journey is fairly classic, but the sumptuous animation and Lin-Manuel Miranda tunes are top-tier Disney. (Sure, we'd love to see Taika Waititi's original script, but we can live without it.)Moana 2, last year’s less well-received sequel, is nowalso streamingon Disney+ (as aresing-along versionsforboth films).</p><p>If your friend told you they'd decided to solo-climb up the sheer 3,000-foot granite El Capitan wall in Yosemite, California, with no rope, you’d think they had gone mad. But that’s exactly what Alex Honnold set out to do back in 2017. Honnold’s quest to climb the vertical wall was documented by his two director friends, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, as he took on the ascent to become the world’s first person to free-climb El Capitan. But it’s not just about the ascent, it’s also about Honnold’s complicated life, his emotional issues, and all the things that have driven him to pursue one of the most dangerous missions ever attempted by any free climber. The cinematography inFree Solois also dizzyingly beautiful, and the entire thing will have you gripping the arm of your chair in terror.</p><p>Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is an experimental inventor who creates an electromagnetic shrinking machine. Naturally, he accidentally shrinks his own children (if you didn’t already guess that from the title), plus the kids from next door, then unwittingly throws them in the trash. To have any chance of becoming their normal size again, the teeny tots must navigate their way across the family's (now seemingly gigantic) yard and back to the house. It's something fraught with peril when you're half the size of an aspirin.</p><p>While it initially might have seemed as if Pixar could never make anything as good as the original 1995Toy Story, each of the three subsequent films add depth to the franchise's canon. All of the movies are critically acclaimed—and they're all available on Disney+. When combined, the four films tell a story about growing up and how everything in life, inevitably, changes. Woody (Tom Hanks) and the gang go from learning how to deal with new people to understanding loss. It's something that's also followed the cast: InToy Story 4, the voice of Mr. Potato Head was created through archive recordings after Don Rickles, as the man behind the voice, died ahead of the film's release.</p><p>Remember the terrifying wildebeest stampede in the 1994 version ofThe Lion King? That was actually computer animated, because drawing them by hand would have taken a long, long time. Special attention was taken to blend it into the cel-shaded backgrounds, and this was all beforeToy Storycame out the following year. Which is all to say that not only is the '90s version a perfect movie that had absolutely zero need for a charm-deficient 2019 remake (which is also streaming on Disney+ in case you want to compare), it’s also the bestLion Kingto use CG animation.</p><p>Heath Ledger singing “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” on the bleachers. That’s the iconic scene in this top-caliber high school romcom. The plot is taken fromThe Taming of the Shrew, the cast—including Ledger, Julia Stiles, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt—are all adorable, and the late '90s nostalgia is potent. Offering some much-needed variety from the sci-fi and animation that dominates the Disney+ launch catalog,10 Things I Hate About Youis as good as comfort-food movies get.</p><p>Tronand its modern sequel,Tron: Legacy, aren't your typical Disney films. The original sees a programmer (Jeff Bridges) become trapped inside a computer system where he meets and befriends programs, including the eponymous hero Tron, who are resisting the power of a growing artificial intelligence, the Master Control Program. It became a sci-fi cult classic, leading to the creation of a modern sequel that continues the story and features an epic score cowritten by Daft Punk. Both are watchable distractions, even if the sequel feels a little thin in places.</p><p>Another nostalgia fest, this time for fans of '80s fantasy.Willowis a family-friendly, mythic quest that’s best seen as George Lucas and Ron Howard’s fun, $35 million Tolkien fan fiction. The story of a farmer tasked with protecting a magic baby from an evil queen is not exactly the most original story in the world, but that hasn’t stopped this from becoming a classic, with Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood and Val Kilmer waving a sword around. Classic Sunday afternoon fare.</p><p>Winter Soldieris among the best Marvel movies. It makes time for quieter character moments, and the action, while still spectacular, feels a little more grounded and real than the CGI-fueled shock and awe of the mainline movies. In this outing, Captain America faces off against a rogue element of SHIELD led by Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce.</p><p>The first two Thor films were among the worst in the whole series—Chris Hemsworth’s thunder god was dour and charmless. But here, director Taika Waititi injected some much-needed color into the proceedings, borrowing heavily from thePlanet Hulkstoryline from the comics. Thor finds himself stranded on a bizarre planet, ruled over by Jeff Goldblum (who is pretty much playing himself). There, he crosses paths with Bruce Banner’s Hulk, who has been missing since the events ofCivil War. It’s hugely funny, and arguably the best film of the series.</p><p>The newerStar Warsone-off films attract strong opinions, andRogue Oneis no different. But while it has its issues, it fills an important hole in the universe and features some of the best action sequences in the entire saga. Its main black mark is the rather iffy CGI recreation of Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin, but it's still a fun romp that lacks the narrative baggage of the new trilogy.</p><p>Black Pantherhad a huge cultural impact. It was refreshingly unusual to see a blockbuster superhero film with such a diverse cast—and the Afrofuturist setting was unlike anything Marvel had ever done before. Michael B. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger, who returns to his father’s home to claim the throne from T’Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman).</p><p>Released in 2008, a time when, for many, the climate crisis felt like a distant, abstract threat,WALL·Eis classic Pixar. It’s a love story—sort of—that focuses on two robots. But it’s also a story about survival, believing in yourself, and dancing through the vacuum of space propelled by a fire extinguisher. The animation, especially on the desolate, barren Earth, is a sight to behold. The opening scenes of the film are also basically a silent film, with the score and robotic sound effects doing a fantastic job bringing out the emotion and drama of what’s happening.</p><p>Pixar'sUpcan claim one of the most moving opening scenes of any movie. Despite being released more than a decade ago, in 2009, the animation hasn't aged or lost any of its charm. In a little over 90 minutes, director Pete Docter takes us on the journey of Carl, an old widower who is seeking out Paradise Falls. Carl's trip in his flying house is made in memory of his wife, Ellie, who had always wanted to visit the falls. The film won two Oscars—Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score—but was also nominated for three more. These included Best Picture, which at the time made it only the second animated film to have received the nomination (1991’sBeauty and the Beast—which is also streaming on Disney+, and most definitely worth a rewatch—was the first).</p><p>Whatever mood you're in, Disney+ hasThe Jungle Bookto suit it. The streaming service has both the 1967 animated classic, with its catchy soundtrack and moments of humor, plus the live-action version released in 2016. The two films couldn't be more different. If you want to go for full family entertainment, pick the original, but if you're after something a little darker, the modern remake is where you should head. (Bonus fact: The entire live-action film was shot in a warehouse.)</p><p>The first volume ofGuardians of the Galaxydidn't burst into the MCU until 2014, which is relatively late considering Phase One began withIron Manin 2008. However, it's become a firm fan favorite, providing some of the Universe's most memorable (and important) characters. Quill, Rocket, Groot, Gamora, and Nebula are all distinctive and in many ways more likable than other key MCU characters.Guardiansis worth returning to if you want to remember a slightly simpler time before Thanos' Snap.</p>

        <p>To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories.</p><p>As themost-watched halftime showof all time—one that exclusively featured Black performers—Kendrick Lamar's historic performanceduringSuper Bowl LIXwas bound to draw some complaints.</p><p>But according to a Federal Communications Commission response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from WIRED, the single biggest source of anger was not about the performance itself. It was that there were not enough white people on stage.</p><p>WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests.Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.</p><p>“I think that it’s racist that there aren’t any white people in this event,” one complainant wrote. Another from Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, added: “There's something wrong when you can't even put white people on with talent.”</p><p>In response to WIRED’s FOIA request, the FCCpublished 125 complaintssent to the agency from some of the more than 133 million people watching. Some complained about the “vulgar” and “obscene” language uses, others focused on their inability to understand “this rap crap,” and some asked why Madonna or Eminem weren’t performing. Despite its detractors, Lamar’s performance was widely considered a cultural feat, coming just a few days after he won five Grammys for theDrake diss track“Not Like Us.”</p><p>But dozens of complainants were open in their beliefs that featuring the all-Black ensemble at halftime was racist against white people, in a bizarre twist on the wider culture war over diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI).</p><p>For years, right-wing politicians and personalities have been loudly blaming DEI policies for everything fromthe attempted assassination of Donald Trumptodoors falling off planesandbridges collapsing. During his 2024 election campaign, Trumpclaimed“there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country.” His administration has since cracked down heavily onDEI policiesat both public and private institutions.</p><p>Some of the initial online backlash to Lamar’s February performance accused the entire show of beinga form of DEI. But the FCC complaints suggest that some Super Bowl viewers feel white people should have been beneficiaries of more diversity.</p><p>“No diversity (white, Latin, Native American, etc.) but it seems the black community got their spotlight,” one viewer from Clovis, California, wrote to the FCC. Another complainant alleges the lack of white people was somehow a throwback to a previous era, as if there was another period in history when only Black people performed at Super Bowl halftime shows. “The absence of representation from other races takes us back in time,” a complainant from Monee, Illinois, wrote.</p><p>Many complainants completely missed what critics said wasthe point of the show,which was to highlight the struggle of Black artists to achieve proper representation while seeing their art, talent, and culture appropriated by others.</p><p>Part of Lamar’s message was delivered by actor Samuel L. Jackson, who played the character of Uncle Sam, but this appeared to be too much for some people. “Why was Uncle Sam Black when Uncle Sam is white,” a viewer from Daytona Beach, Florida, complained while appearing to suggest that Uncle Sam was an actual historical character rather than a symbol of military propaganda. “Racist and anti-white NFL show,” another angry viewer wrote. “Samuel Jackson as Uncle Sam mocked white people.”</p><p>Others attempted to thinly mask their racist comments by using dog whistles, describing the show as “very ghetto” and “low life trash.”</p><p>The controversy over Lamar’s performance highlights the hypocrisy around the DEI backlash; experts say the term has come to serve as amodern-day slurwielded against people of color, while at the same time, the people offended by it see themselves as being victims of a lack of diversity.</p>

    <h1>SignalGate Is Driving the Most US Downloads of Signal Ever</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 27, 2025</span>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>To revisit this article, visit My Profile, thenView saved stories.</p><p>SignalGate, as it'scome to be called, may be the biggest scandal to hit the Trump administration in its first months in power. But it's been great forSignal.</p><p>Since thenews brokeon Monday thatsenior Trump administration cabinet membersaccidentally included the editor in chief of The Atlantic in a group chat on the Signal encrypted messaging platform where the officials were making secret plans to bomb Yemen, the ensuing news cycle and the constant mentions of Signal have led to the encrypted messaging platform doubling its usual rate of new downloads, the nonprofit organization that runs Signal tells WIRED. Given that 2025 has already been a “banner year” for Signal's growth, according to Signal's leadership, that makes this week the single biggest bump in US adoption of the app in Signal's nearly 11 years of existence.</p><p>“In Signal’s history, this is the largest US-growth moment by a massive margin,” says Jun Harada, Signal's head of growth and partnerships. “It’s mind-blowing, even on our side.”</p><p>Harada declined to give absolute numbers for Signal's user growth beyond saying that its total downloads are in the “hundreds of millions,” which has been the case for several years. But he said that the week’s rate of adoption has been twice that of a typical week for 2025, which in turn was twice that of a typical week the same time last year. “It happened immediately” after The Atlantic broke the story of Signal's use in the Yemeni bombing, Harada says. “And it’s been sustained. We’ve been maintaining that rate every day.”</p><p>In Signal's history, the only comparable spike in adoption occurred when WhatsAppchanged its privacy policy in 2021, Harada says, leading to millions of users abandoning that communications app. But that incident mostly brought non-Americans to Signal, unlike the current, US-focused SignalGate bump.</p><p>Numbers from the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower largely align with Signal's own analysis of that growth: The company says that Signal downloads in the US increased 105 percent compared to the prior week—and 150 percent compared to an average week in 2024. Outside of the US, Sensor Tower saw only a 21 percent increase in Signal downloads compared to the prior week.</p><p>The Atlantic's revelation on Monday that secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, national security adviser Michael Waltz, vice president JD Vance, and other Trump administration officials used a Signal group chat to plan an air strike against Houthi rebels in Yemen—and that Waltz accidentally added Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg to that group in a shocking breach of confidentiality—has raised serious questions about the security practices of the Trump administration that are still resonating days later.</p><p>The scandal has called into question whether the executive branch officials were planning the air strike using vulnerable non-approved or even personal devices rather than the secure machines intended for classified conversations. Screenshots of the group chatpublished by The Atlantic on Wednesdayindicate that the officials were using Signal's disappearing messages feature to delete their communications, potentially in violation of US record retention laws.</p><p>The incident has raised sometimes-misguided questions, too, about whether Signal itself is to blame for the breach—including from President Trump, who suggested in comments on Wednesday that Signal might be “defective"—despitemany cybersecurity and encryption experts' recommendation of Signalas the best end-to-end encrypted messaging tool freely available to the public. “You use Signal, we use Signal, everyone uses Signal,” Trump told reporters, “but it could be a defective platform.”</p><p>Signal's Harada declined to respond to Trump's “defective” comment and pointed to Signal'sprevious statementsthat it has yet to see any evidence of any vulnerability in the app, much less one that has anything to do with Jeffrey Goldberg being accidentally added to a White House group chat.</p><p>But Harada noted that the overall attention to Signal—even the president himself saying that “everyone uses Signal” in the Oval Office—is an example of the kind of visibility it has never had before. “All awareness for Signal is a net positive. The interest in Signal continues to be at an all-time high,” Harada says.</p><p>“I don’t think my phone has ever buzzed this much, from people from every walk of life. People are learning about Signal who maybe have never even heard about or considered encrypted messaging before.” Harada also pointed to areportthat Google searches for “Signal” were up more than 1,000 percent.</p><p>Harada says that Signal was already seeing a significant uptick in adoption in the first few months of 2025. He attributes that growth partly to increasing general interest in privacy among consumers and partly to the breach of nine US telecoms by China's Salt Typhoon hacker group, which led to the hackers accessing some targets' real-time calls and texts. Federal officials at the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency responded to those breaches by publicly recommending that Americansuse encrypted messaging and calling applications.</p><p>But all of that has been dwarfed by the attention and interest Signal has received this week. As messy as SignalGate may be, Harada says, it has made Signal a household name like never before. “To have this kind of mainstream moment is massive,” he says. “I believe it’s a sea change for private encrypted messaging for the US and the world.”</p>

    <h1>The Best Phones You Can’t Buy in the US</h1>

        <p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>There’s a world of excellent flagship smartphones that push photography to new levels and budget buys that confound expectations, but you won't find them in the US for various reasons. Some Chinese phone manufacturers are banned, while other brands prefer to focus their efforts in countries where Apple doesn't have a massive market share. Whatever the reason, I've tested these global handsets for years—these are the best phones you can’t officially buy in the US.</p><p>Many of these phone makers like to release multiple devices under sub-brands, so here are some basic facts to know: Xiaomi is the brand behind Poco and Redmi; Nubia is a ZTE brand; Honor was a Huawei subsidiary but separatedafter Huawei was banned; and Realme spun out of Oppo. Before diving in, it’s worth noting that folks in the UK and Europe can also buy many of the phones in ourBest Android Phones,Best iPhones, andBest Cheap Phonesguides on sale in the US.</p><p>Power up with unlimited access toWIRED.Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just$2.50$1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content.Subscribe Today.</p><p>Should You Import One of These Phones?</p><p>While some phones are not officially sold in the US or other countries, you can still get your hands on them. They're easy to buy online, and you may even find some on Amazon, but there are a few things to consider before buying.</p><p>The technologies and specific bands that cellular networks rely upon differ from country to country. While models described as “global” and even UK or European models are likely to work in the US, they may not support all the bands your carrier uses. Missing LTE or 5G bands can mean patchy service or even relegate you to 3G. Chinese and other country-specific models will almost certainly lack some common US bands and may not work on some carrier networks.</p><p>Always check the supported bands and cross-reference with your carrier. You will often find this information in the listing or aggregated on websites likeKimovil, but I recommend checking directly with the manufacturer and your carrier.</p><p>Depending on where you buy, importing a phone can lead to customs charges and add a significant expense to the overall cost. Do your research and factor in the potential extra fee before you buy.</p><p>It is common for phones only released in China to ship without any Google services, including the Google Play Store. Many Chinese manufacturers have their own app stores or preinstall third-party app stores on their phones for the Chinese market. Sometimes it's a simple case of checking a box to unlock and download Google services, but this is not always true.</p><p>Even where Google services are supported, some Chinese phones never work properly with certain apps, such as Android Auto. You are often stuck with specific Chinese default apps and services, and many banking apps won’t work as they would on a US or global model.</p><p>The latest Huawei phones run HarmonyOS. Although it was originally forked from the Android Open Source Project, it is now completely separate, and Huawei phones can no longer run Android apps. Following its US ban, the company has developed an independent ecosystem of apps and services.</p><p>Xiaomi’s flagship 15 Ultra (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a top-notch phone in every regard, but the camera is where it shines. Leaning into its partnership with Leica, Xiaomi has gone with a design that evokes retro cameras and makes a feature of that impressively versatile quad-lens system. Yes, that's four cameras: a 50-megapixel primary, 50-megapixel ultrawide, 50-megapixel 3X optical zoom, and a 200-megapixel periscope sensor with 4.3X optical zoom. I've got lots of greatphoto samples in my review.</p><p>The 6.73-inch screen is lovely and bright with a variable1- to 120-Hz refresh rate. Performance is slick, with generous storage, solid battery life, and fast wired or wireless charging. Xiaomi has committed to four Android updates and six years of security patches too. But no device is perfect, so you'll have to deal with flaws like bloatware, Xiaomi’s HyperOS software, and that colossal camera bump. I also think Xiaomi’s AI features are below par, and it doesn't help that the 15 Ultra is pricey.</p><p>Coming close to matching our top pick on specs, Honor’s Magic 7 Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is another excellent flagship phone. The triple-lens camera doesn’t quite reach the same highs, but there’s a gorgeous 6.8-inch screen, speedy performance, good battery life, and a dualIP68 and IP69 rating, meaning it can handle the elements and submersions in water. Honor’s Magic OS9 boasts more polished AI features than the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, but how useful they are for most folks is debatable. Honor also recently announcedan increased commitmentto seven years of Android version and security patch updates.</p><p>On the downside, the Magic 7 Pro has a large camera cut-out on the front, the camera processing is sometimes heavy-handed, and the ultrawide camera struggles to match the other two lenses. While the design is slick, it's also a little dull.</p><p>The first folding phone to serve as my daily driver, the Honor Magic V3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the slimmest book-style foldable devices (4.4 millimeters when open). It’s a pleasure to use and feels close to a regular phone when closed, but has two lovely screens (6.43-inch and 7.92-inch), long battery life, a versatile camera, interesting AI features, and fast wired and wireless charging. There’s also a responsive fingerprint sensor in the power button and some useful AI features in Honor’s MagicOS software. If Honor sold it in the US, it'd be the top pick in ourBest Folding Phonesguide.</p><p>Fitting flagship cameras into folding phones is tough, so the Magic V3 doesn’t quite match up to our top two picks above, with a mediocre ultrawide camera. Honor’s software also doesn’t always work perfectly, and this phone came out before Honor’s seven-year update promise, so it gets four Android upgrades and five years of security patches.</p><p>If you want a mobile gaming device first and a phone second, the Nubia Redmagic 10 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is for you. From the transparent industrial design with built-in fans and vents to the unbroken, almost bezel-free 6.85-inch AMOLED screen and144-Hz refresh rate, this phone is designed for gamers. You also get a whopping 7,050-mAh battery and customizable capacitive-touch shoulder triggers. Performance is slick, thanks to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite and speedy RAM (LPDDR5X) and storage (UFS 4.1). It can run all your favorite games with all the bells and whistles. This is easily the best gaming phone at this price.</p><p>There’s some compromise with the camera, which is rough around the edges and includes a useless 2-MP macro lens. The software is also shoddy in places, and the promise of just one Android version upgrade, two Redmagic OS updates, and three years of security updates is a real turn-off.</p><p>If money is tight, this midrange marvel demands a place on your short list. Xiaomi’s Poco X7 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a compelling bargain that combines a lovely 6.67-inch display with relatively fast performance, good battery life, speedy wired charging, and IP68 water resistance. The 50-megapixel main camera is decent. The Poco X7 Pro runs Android 15 with HyperOS on top, and Xiaomi offers three Android version updates and four years of security patches.</p><p>There is too much bloatware to deal with, and Xiaomi’s software is not the best. The 8-megapixel ultrawide and 20-megapixel selfie cameras are poor. You also don’t get wireless charging, though that’s par for the course at this price.</p><p>These phones are worth considering if you have yet to see something you like.</p><p>Oppo Find N5 for £1,106: It’s a real shame that the Find N5 won’t even land in the UK or Europe, because the world’s slimmest book-style foldable (3.6 millimeters open) is a lovely phone. The 6.62-inch cover display and 8.12-inch inner display are excellent, and the Find N5 has top specs all the way (Snapdragon 8 Elite, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB storage, 5,600-mAh battery, 80-watt wired and 50-watt wireless charging). The triple-lens camera (50-MP main, 50-MP telephoto, 8-MP ultrawide) is the most obvious compromise, a necessity for this form factor. The slightly buggy software and bloatware are the only other detractors, but the potential pain of importing will be enough to put most folks off.</p><p>Xiaomi Poco F7 Ultra for £649 and F7 Pro for £499: While Poco has traditionally been a budget brand, the aptly named F7 Ultra takes it into new territory. This phone boasts a few flagship-level features, such as the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with the VisionBoost D7 for graphics, a powerful triple-lens camera, and a lovely, high-resolution 6.67-inch display with a 120-Hz refresh rate. It also scores an IP68 rating and offers up to 50-watt wireless charging. The catch is a price hike over previous Poco F series releases, but at the early-bird price, the F7 Ultra is a compelling bargain. The F7 Pro is more in line with what we expect from the brand, with an older processor, limited camera, and no wireless charging. Both run Xiaomi's HyperOS 2 and have too much bloatware, but Xiaomi now promises four Android version upgrades and six years of security patches.</p><p>Realme 14 Pro+ for €530: The color-changing finish may be gimmicky, but it's fun, and this phone looks and feels far more expensive than it is. There are more highs than lows on the spec sheet. You get a triple-lens camera, an IP68/69 rating, a 6,000-mAh battery, and a 6.83-inch OLED display with a 120-Hz refresh rate, but the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset is limited, there's no wireless charging support, and no charger in the box. It is still quite a bargain and should be landing in the UK soon.</p><p>Xiaomi 15 for £899: Folks seeking a more compact phone than the Xiaomi 15 Ultra could do a lot worse than its smaller sibling. The Xiaomi 15 feels lovely, with a 6.36-inch screen, a decent triple-lens camera, and top-notch internals. But it’s a conservative design, kind of pricey, and it has the same software and bloatware issues as the Ultra.</p><p>Honor Magic 7 RSR for £1,550: Designed with Porsche, this souped-up version of the 7 Pro above has a fancier design with a hexagonal camera module, a slightly improved telephoto lens, 24 GB of RAM (likely largely pointless), 1 TB of storage, and a bigger battery (5,850 mAh). It’s lovely but doesn’t do enough to justify the additional outlay.</p><p>Oppo Find X8 Pro for £1,099: The last two Oppo flagships didn’t officially make it to the UK and Europe, so the X8 Pro marks a welcome return. This is a polished phone with a quad-lens camera (all 50 MP), but it feels like a downgrade from theFind X7 Ultra I used last yearbecause of the smaller sensor. It is fast, with excellent battery life, speedy wired and wireless charging, IP68/69 protection, and no obvious omissions. But it’s pricey, and flagships should not have bloatware. I’d prefer to wait for the X8 Ultra.</p><p>Honor 200 Pro for £499: I don’t love the design of the Honor 200 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review), but it has a versatile triple-lens camera with a capable portrait mode. There are also some useful AI features, and the battery life is good, with fast wired and wireless charging. It cost £200 more at launch, but at this new lower price, it is a far more attractive option.</p><p>Xiaomi Mix Flip for £749: Xiaomi’s first flip phone is surprisingly good, with two relatively bright and roomy screens, solid stamina, fast charging, and snappy performance. It’s a shame Xiaomi didn’t craft more flip screen-specific features. It doesn't help that the Mix Flip was too expensive at launch (£1,099), but at this reduced price, it’s a decent shout for folks craving a folding flip phone.</p><p>Nubia Z70 Ultra for £749: Much like last year’s Z60 Ultra (6/10, WIRED Review), the Z70 Ultra is a value-packed brick with an excellent 6.8-inch display, Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, versatile triple-lens camera, and 6,150-mAh battery. Unfortunately, the camera is inconsistent and poor at recording video, and the software is shoddy (with only three Android version updates promised).</p><p>Oppo Reno 12 Pro for £395: There are a couple of reasons to consider the Reno 12 Pro: the camera and the battery life. A main camera and a telephoto lens, both rated at 50 megapixels, are rare at this price (there’s also an 8-MP ultrawide and a 50-MP selfie camera). But I don’t like the plastic design, there’s bloatware galore, and the performance is just OK.</p><p>Xiaomi 14T Pro for £470: As the mid-year follow-up toXiaomi’s flagship 14, the 14T Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a bit of a bargain and has dropped in price since I reviewed it. The basics are nailed, with a big screen, good performance, plenty of stamina, and a solid camera. But there is bloatware, Xiaomi’s software, and the lack of wireless charging to contend with.</p><p>OnePlus Nord 4 for £369: With a metal unibody, the Nord 4 stands out and also boasts an excellent screen, enough processing power for most folks, impressive battery life, and fast charging. The main camera is fine, and there’s a nifty AquaTouch feature that lets you use the phone with wet hands. But there's no wireless charging, the ultrawide camera is disappointing, and there’s some bloatware.</p><p>These aren’t bad phones necessarily, but we think you’d be better served by something above.</p><p>Xiaomi Mix Fold 4 for £1,085: Only officially released in China, the Xiaomi Mix Fold 4 is a stylish folding phone with a 6.56-inch outer screen that folds open to reveal a 7.98-inch inner screen. It also offers solid performance and battery life, but despite having a large quad-lens camera module, the camera is underwhelming. The crease is also pronounced, and using a Chinese model is a bit of a pain as various things are not translated, and there’s work in getting the apps you want.</p><p>Realme GT7 Pro for £774: This potential flagship killer has a 6.78-inch OLED screen, a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, and an enormous 6,500-mAh battery. You also get a triple-lens camera, but the 50-megapixel main and telephoto lenses are let down by the 8-megapixel ultrawide. It also lacks wireless charging, and you’ll have to import it to the UK, as it only seems to be on sale in Germany.</p><p>Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 Pro+ for £369: An attractive, durable design (IP68), a 200-megapixel Samsung camera sensor, and decent battery life with superfast charging (120-watts) must be balanced against middling performance, poor ultrawide (8 MP) and macro (2 MP) lenses, and a ton of bloatware. Ultimately, there’s little improvement over last year’s Redmi Note 13 Pro+ (6/10, WIRED Review), and it’s not just that there are better phones for the same money; there are better Xiaomi phones.</p><p>Xiaomi Poco F6 for £268orF6 Pro for £339: A real bargain when first released, the Poco F6 series (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is still tempting with a big screen, decent performance, and a pretty capable camera, but there’s bloatware, shoddy software, and limited long-term support. The F6 is a better value than the Pro.</p><p>Motorola Edge 50 Pro for £399: It may be falling in price, but the Motorola Edge 50 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) only has a couple of Android upgrades to go. While the design is compact and there’s a lovely display, I found it lacked processing power, with sometimes sluggish camera performance, and there are better options above.</p><p>Nubia Flip 5G for £419: We had some fun with the Nubia Flip 5G (6/10, WIRED Review), and it was the cheapest flip foldable available for a while. The circular cover screen is cute, but it can’t do much. The performance was average a year ago, and the annoying software and update policy are major strikes against it.</p><p>10% Off Wayfair Promo Code with sign-up</p><p>20% off Dyson Promo Code</p><p>$50 Off In-Person Tax Prep When You Switch From Your Tax Current Provider</p><p>Up to $500 off cameras at Canon</p><p>Save extra 10% Off TurboTax</p><p>Exclusive: Up To 50% Off 6 Boxes With Factor Promo Code</p>

    <h1>Nintendo Is Changing the Way Digital Games Work</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Nintendo is overhaulinghow digital downloads work onNintendo SwitchandSwitch 2with a new feature it’s calling “Virtual Game Cards.” Virtual Game Cards, which the company said during Thursday’s Nintendo Direct livestream will launch in late April, are designed to better mimic the flexibility of physical games.</p><p>It works like this: After buying a digital version of a game, the virtual card is loaded onto the player’s Switch. Players can load or “eject” these game cards; with two systems, a player could eject a game on one system and load it onto another to play from that handheld. Although players will need a local connection to do so, it allows them to swap multiple games between systems quickly.</p><p>The feature could fundamentally change the landscape for digitally downloaded games, which have become increasingly popular over the past several years as brick-and-mortar retailers have shuttered and physical copies have become less important to some players. Digital copies offer a fast, easy way to get a new game, as long as players have an internet connection. But ownership of a digital game is far more murky than with physical media. Companies canremove digital gamesfrom storefronts at any time, and there’s no fun secondary market for collectors. It’s also not possible to resell a digital game, or loan it out without sharing account details.</p><p>What Nintendo is doing with Virtual Game Cards does offer some flexibility on that last point. The virtual cards can be lent out to other players via a local connection in Family Groups, which link together several Nintendo accounts. But only one game can be shared between two people at one time for two weeks. It’s unclear if a game that’s been lent out can still be played by the original owner. WIRED has reached out to Nintendo for clarification and will update accordingly.</p><p>Production and sales of physical games media and consoles stand to take a massive hit in the US if President Trump follows through with proposed tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico, where many video game components are made. The Entertainment Software Association releaseda statement in Februarywarning that “tariffs on video game devices and related products would negatively impact hundreds of millions of Americans and would harm the industry’s significant contributions to the US economy.” Tariffs could both increase prices and reduce availability for physical game products, making digital games more attractive to consumers.</p><p>While Nintendo shared many details about Virtual Game Cards during Thursday’s event, it did not share any news about theSwitch 2. Another Nintendo Direct focusing on the new console is planned for April 2. The company did offer a brief look atMetroid Prime 4: Beyond, which will give its heroine Samus mysterious new physic abilities. The game is still expected this year, though it’s possible a firm release date will be announced alongside the Switch 2 news next week.</p><p>This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.</p>

    <h1>Review: Light Phone III</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">

        <p>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.</p><p>8/10</p><p>“You don't drivea bus everywhere you go,” Kaiwei Tang tells me in a large startup lab in Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York City. He's a cofounder of Light Phone.</p><p>The bus in this analogy is asmartphone, and all the seats are apps. As the driver, you're trying to focus on the road, but all of the notifications from your passenger apps on this very packed bus are vying for your attention, distracting you from what's right in front of your eyes. Tang believes you can get by with, say, a bicycle—one seat, no distractions, getting you from point A to point B. In this case, the bicycle is theLight Phone III.</p><p>This is the latest from the Brooklyn-based company that made a splash with theLight Phone II in 2019. Its devices focus purely on utility, basic phone functions with no access to app stores—with a few extra capabilities overdumb phones—so you won't be hounded with Slack notifications when you're on vacation. Outside of a workplace reprieve, it tries to wean you off the dopamine rush of social media—less incentive to hold your phone in front of your face at a concert, so you can enjoy the show instead of posting about it to Instagram Stories.</p><p>The Light Phone III is a significant upgrade over its predecessor, shedding an E Ink screen in favor of a responsive OLED panel, a wider design that's friendlier for typing messages, better hardware all around, not to mention improved connectivity options. It also now commands a premium price—$599—a number that caused my dad to spit out his coffee when I told him. (The price could rise over the coming months due totariffs.) But if there's a chance it could mitigate screen time woes, is it worth it?</p><p>While Tang and his fellow cofounder Joe Hollier have completely replaced their smartphones with Light Phones, they don't think the Light Phone III needs to replaceyoursmartphone. You can go thatroute if you're bold, or you can think of it as a second phone. Choose when you want that digital detox and leave the smartphone at home—you can easily transfer your SIM card between devices. There's also eSIM support, though switching this around could prove annoying based on your carrier.</p><p>Light Phone III</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>There's only one global version now, so you can use the Light Phone III when traveling without connectivity issues. (This was a problem on the Light Phone II.) In the US, it's5G/4G LTE certified onT-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T, Boost, Mint, Ting, and US Mobile. You may be able to utilize a carrier service to share one phone number across multiple devices, likeT-Mobile Digits, but few carriers have an option like this nowadays.</p><p>I'm onGoogle Fi, and since it's not supported, I couldn't completely ditch my smartphone during my testing period. (I could send but not receive texts.) I purposefully tried to avoid using it when I was out and about with the Light Phone III, but I needed it on hand to avoid missing calls or texts on my personal number. That said, I texted my Light Phone III phone number to a few family members and friends and asked them to save it. You can set up call forwarding, though it doesn't solve the texting issue. It's also important to know that there are no third-party messaging clients for the Light Phone III, so no WhatsApp or Signal.</p><p>What exactly can this cute, boxy device do? Unsurprisingly it keeps things basic, with just a few utility apps and nothing more: You'll get Phone, Alarm, Album, Calculator, Calendar, Camera, Directions, Directory, Hotspot, Music, Notes, Podcasts, and Timer. The 3.92-inch matte OLED screen, which is far more responsive than the E Ink on the Light Phone II, allows you to swipe through the vertical touchscreen interface. It's super fluid and smooth, no doubt thanks to the upgraded Qualcomm SM 4450 chipset inside with 6 GB of RAM.</p><p>On the left side of the device is a rotating knob that control's the screen's brightness. Press it and it'll turn on a bright flash, which I found useful as I wasbuilding a PCover the weekend in my dimly lit office. Over on the right are two volume buttons with a back button between them. Further below is a camera button—a half-press triggers the focus—and along the top edge is a power button.</p><p>Light Phone III</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>The bottom grille is the stereo speaker, and the audio is surprisingly good—it can get decently loud! I had to relearn how to download music, but once I did, I uploaded a few albums, likeGNX,through the Light Phone's web dashboard on my PC. (The phone has 128 GB of internal storage.) Unfortunately, there's no headphone jack, but you can use Bluetooth to pair wireless earbuds. It paired swiftly with my car's Bluetooth so I could pump out tunes or podcasts on rides. Speaking of, it's easy toadd specific podcaststhrough the online dashboard, and you can force the Podcasts tool to sync on the device to get new episodes.</p><p>Microphone quality is also rock solid. I took multiple calls, and no one found my voice quality lacking. Even in the Notes app, you can either write notes or record voice memos, and my voice sounds clear, though I primarily recorded myself in relatively quiet environments.</p><p>The 1,800-mAh battery easily lasts around two days. If you play music or podcasts for several hours, that will drop down considerably. It charges via USB-C. Four screws on the back allow for easier battery replacements, though this means you get just anIP54 water resistance rating; fine in the rain, but don't drop it in water.</p><p>You'll probably use the Phone tool the most. Adding contacts was a quick affair on the dashboard via Google Contacts (you can upload a .VCF), and texting is so much nicer on this handset over its predecessor, thanks to the wider design—though there's voice-to-text if you still find it cramped. You can even attach images you've captured from the Light Phone III to convos.</p><p>The Directions tool is surprisingly helpful. It's powered byHere, and I successfully got Google Maps–style driving and walking directions. However, I have noticed that the built-in GPS is a little slow to find its position, especially indoors. There's a public transit option, though this is more akin to printing a set of directions from MapQuest.</p><p>I quite like the Directory. If you want to find a nearby coffee shop or look up the hours of a museum, type it in and you'll get a collection of details like hours of operation, contact information, and even a star rating (sometimes). You get quick options to navigate there via the monochrome map or to place a call.</p><p>On the back is a 50-megapixel camera paired with an 8-megapixel selfie camera. The results were better than expected, but that might be because I had low expectations. Asmartphone of comparable valuewill easily trounce the photo quality of the Light Phone III, but I found myself enjoying the lo-fi look of these images. In low-light settings, you'll have to adjust the exposure compensation to get anything usable. Even then, it'll look super grainy, but that's in vogue, right? Right now, you have to hook up the Light Phone III to a computer and enable Media Transfer on the handset to transfer photos, but eventually they'll sync to the web dashboard.</p><p>Light Phone III</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>Some hardware features aren't in use yet. For example, there's a fingerprint sensor baked into the power button, but it's not live (Tang says soon). There's NFC on the back of the device, and the hope is to add a tap-to-pay service akin to Apple Pay or Google Wallet. Eventually, the company wants to add video messaging capabilities for the selfie camera, though it's unclear what platform it would support.</p><p>While there aren't any third-party apps yet, Tang and Hollier talked up a potential partnership with Lyft to bring a ridesharing utility to Light Phone users. It's unclear when this would arrive, but the team of 15 people has been delivering a steady set of features to the Light Phone II for the past six years—many of the aforementioned tools debuted there through software updates, so they have a good track record.</p><p>The longer you use the Light Phone III, the more you'll think:Well, it'd be nice if they just added this feature.I've already thought up a handful, almost all for utility and not doomscrolling, mind you. Google Authenticator, for example, would allow me to log into certain websites if I only take my laptop and Light Phone III to the coffee shop to work.</p><p>Light Phone III</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>This will never happen, but I'd love to get alerts from my security cameras in case something's wrong when I'm away. I know it doesn't have an E Ink screen anymore, but the ability to read ebooks would be nifty on this matte screen—the size makes it great for one-handed reading, and we all know how popular theBoox Palma 2was last year. I'd also love a way to run basic searches (Idon'twant a web browser). Too often in group conversations, I'll say, “Oh, I'll look it up,” then stop what I'm doing and blankly say, “Never mind, can you?”</p><p>Everyone probably hasonething they'd like to see on this device, and if the developers catered to every need, this would turn into a smartphone quite quickly. The Light Phone III is a lesson in letting go and learning that you don't need access to that bus-load of apps every waking moment.</p><p>I reviewed the original Light Phone II in 2019 and saidit's not the cure for smartphone addiction. Now? It absolutely is. But the price is a big problem. I understandwhyit's so expensive—it's a small team producing small batches, so there's no economy of scale. Some components are custom and not off the shelf, like the OLED screen, and Light Phone is planning on supporting the hardware for more than five years, meaning a continued stream of updates that require resources.</p><p>The good news is that the Light Phone II is still available, and it has many of the same software features, though it is not as user-friendly and responsive. Yes, you can buya feature phoneand enjoy the same levels ofdigital detox, but there's nothing quite like the Light Phone III. It might have sat in my pocket far longer than any otherphone I've tested, but it has an aesthetic that makes me enjoy using it in those limited interactions. Best of all, it's given me more time to take care of a few things around the house this past week instead of scrolling through Instagram all day.</p><p>Light Phone III</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p>

It combines hot and cold therapy to tackle puffiness, improve circulation, and better absorb skincare products before application. The curved applicator and precision tip zero in on tricky spots, like under the eyes or across the jawline. The Depuffing Wand has three preset temperature levels for each mode. The cryotherapy is consistent throughout the six-minute session—plus, it won’t drip or crack if you forget about it in the freezer like traditional ice rollers. (Don’t put it in the freezer.) There’s also a little light that flashes at the three-minute mark to remind you to switch sides, though you’ll miss it if you’re too busy staring into your soul in the mirror.</p><p>Sometimes, the only way to check out is to beam yourself into another world, preferably one with juicier plotlines. This projector has 450 ISO lumens and 1080p resolution, with 4K support and color calibration. The gimbal stand tilts 165 degrees for projecting on walls, ceilings, or the back of an RV. The included hard-shell case is great for portability and easy storage. It runs for 2.5 hours on a single charge, and it's power bank-compatible, so you can watch from anywhere. Its AI-powered setup takes care of autofocus, screen fit, obstacle avoidance, and keystone correction, so she doesn't have to fiddle with settings with every tectonic shake. For more projectors,check out our guide.</p><p>Not everyone has the square footage for a full-on meditation temple, but this 11-inch wonder is compact enough to fit on a console or side table. The teeny metal sphere slides through sand, fabricating spellbinding patterns that lure your mind into a tranquil trance. With over 100 hypnotic designs and ambient light options, it’s a customizable zen garden. You can tweak the speed, soundscapes, or even commence a guided meditation through its companion app. It’s mindfulness made smart, so she can get some peace at least for a few minutes.</p><p>These Speks Odds Silicone Fidget Magnets are here to help you survive your stay in the stress-stricken simulation. Each set comes with three palm-sized magnets, encased in soft and textured silicone, that are designed to keep your hands busy while your brain zones out. I can’t stop fiddling with them when I’m watching TV and during Zoom calls. I can’t risk losing them by taking them outside, so they’ve found a home on my desk.</p><p>Speks also sellsstarter kitsandgift bundlespacked with other fidget toys. I lovedthe Moon Jelly Gump Memory Gel Stress Ball, until I handed it to my boyfriend for five minutes and he popped it. Men ruin everything.</p><p>The Deco Gravity Bong is here to defy more than just gravity. Handmade from thick borosilicate glass, this tabletop beauty isn’t just functional—it belongs on display. Aesthetically, it delivers an old-world opulence that makes you feel like you’re lounging in a 1920s speakeasy. It’s also discreet enough to blend into your glassware or home decor collection. It’s composed of four easy-to-clean components—shell, core, 14mm bowl, and a silicone gasket—that are also replaceable if something shatters, so she doesn’t have to shell out for a whole new set. A few colors are already sold out (petalandorchid), but you can still find it inbaltic amber,charcoal,emerald, orclear.</p><p>The Everywhere Toteis for the woman who is going where the universe takes her. It has everything one might need for far-flung travels: a 16-inch padded laptop sleeve, a handful of interior pockets, and a water-resistant nylon exterior for when you’re caught in an otherworldly atmospheric anomaly. Available in elemental shades likecoast blue,sea green, andclay pink—it’s at home anywhere, from the gym to an impromptu odyssey. If she needs to jet off on a moment’s notice, it’s got a key clip, a trolley sleeve, and an exterior pocket for her wallet and passport. It also meets airlines’personal item requirements.</p><p>If we must remain on this planet, we might as well have perfect hair while we do it. The AirLight Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) uses near-infrared light, high wind speed, and controlled heat to dry hair faster, more quietly, and with less damage than most traditionalhair dryers. It leaves strands 33 percent more hydrated and 59 percent smoother, all while using 31 percent less energy—which is more than we can say for most people in power.</p><p>It’s not cheap, but it’s only slightly pricier than aDyson SuperSonicand unlike the Dyson, it’s repairable if something breaks. Bonus: It works abroad, so whether she’s escaping to a tropical vacation or an underground bunker, at least her hair will be fabulous.</p><p>If she needs a break from reality (or perhaps is scouting for new planets), the Celestron StarSense Dobsonian Telescope (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the perfect gift. It offers some of the best optics you can get for under $1,000, and its Celestron StarSense app makes celestial navigation easy, even for first-time stargazers. WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson says this Newtonian telescope, with its two-axis altazimuth mount, is not too heavy or difficult to operate. This means she can use it in her backyard or haul it to a remote desert where she can pretend humanity doesn’t exist for a while.</p><p>Reality is overrated. Why not log off this timeline and into another? The Meta Quest 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite VR headset, offering pure escapism in an untethered PC-free package. It's lighter and comfier than its predecessor, with better visuals, improved object detection, and hand tracking. According to WIRED contributor Matt Kamen, the metaverse is pretty much a ghost town … which is great for us; the fewer dudes, the better. Come to think of it, how cool would it be if we did take over the metaverse? We could call it the FemmeVerse. (All right, I'll keep brainstorming.)</p><p>Walking home alone at night on this planet is an absolute nightmare. If she can’t teleport away from creeps, she can at least blast a 130-decibel siren and flashing strobe light in their direction. The Birdie is a small but mighty alarm that will (hopefully) deter attackers and alert anyone nearby for help.</p><p>I’ve used the original model for over a year (see my thoughts in my guide to theBest Personal Safety Alarms), and it’s given me peace of mind whenever I’m walking solo. The Birdie+, which I have yet to test, adds some useful features like location sharing, emergency support, and even a fake call function for a quick exit strategy. Plus, it comes in the cutest patterns. My one caveat is that this wouldn't be my first choice as a birthday gift, as it's kind of a downer.</p><p>If she’s training for a marathon, tracking her stress cycles, or just wants hard data to justify why she feels like garbage, the Oura Ring 4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the most stylish health tracker out there. Packed with advanced sensors, it monitors heart rate, skin temperature, sleep quality, and stress levels. WIRED editor Adrienne So has worn one for years, and it remains one of the only wearables that can reliably predict her menstrual cycle. Plus, it works with both Android and iOS, so she’s not locked into a single tech ecosystem.</p><p>She’s been carrying the weight of the world for far too long. The Hyperice Venom 2 Back melts away tension with targeted heat and vibration therapy. With three heat levels (up to 131 degrees Fahrenheit) and three vibration settings, it stimulates circulation, loosens tight muscles in the lower back, and offers relief when you’re sitting at your desk for eight hours trying not to scream. It also doubles as a soothing heat pad for period cramps. Best of all, it automatically shuts off, so she can zone out without worrying about turning it off. Check out some other options in our guide to theBest Massagers.</p><p>Yes,you read that right. The LARQ Bottle PureVis (as seen in our guide to theBest Reusable Water Bottles) is a self-cleaning, reusable water bottle that uses UV-C light to sterilize itself every two hours. No more moldy smells, biofilm buildup, or questionable aftertastes. It’s double-insulated BPA-free stainless steel and the charge lasts three weeks—so she doesn’t have to worry about germs while she’s fighting the patriarchy. The PureVis 2 also includes a filter, but it tends to slip off inside the bottle, so I can go without it.</p><p>The TherabodySleepMask is a game-changer during flights. Where else would I have to block out every living being than the airport? I can confirm it is 99.9 percent (is anything ever 100?) effective at blocking light. The standout feature, though, is that it uses three vibration patterns designed to lull you into a deeper sleep. The contoured padding feels like pillows on my eyelids, and the adjustable strap keeps it in place without tugging at my hair. I tend to wake up multiple times at night, but with the SleepMask, I can just turn on another session of the vibration, and it usually puts me back to sleep.</p><p>She may not be able to move to another planet, but shecanbuild a 3D model of the Milky Way from the comfort of her home.

    <h1>Inside Maye Musk’s Cozy Relationship With China</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 27, 2025</span>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>In January, with anationwide banon TikTok looming, hundreds of thousands of people in the USbegan flockingto another Chinese social media app called RedNote—only to find that Maye Musk, Elon Musk’s mother, had already established a relatively large audience on the platform. Maye, who has become a celebrity in her own right in China over the past few years, had over 600,000 followers on RedNote when the flood of Americans arrived.</p><p>“I need to find the block button,” one American user commented under Maye’slatest video at the time, which has received over 10,000 likes. “I can’t believe I’m witnessing American people confronting Musk’s mom to her face,” another comment in Chinese reads. Shortly afterward, Maye’s comment section on RedNote was closed for several weeks. New comments didn’t start showing up again until early February.</p><p>The incident represented a rare moment when the parallel public images Maye Musk has created for herself collided. In China, the 76 year-old has built a largely apolitical reputation as a “silver influencer,” fashion model for local brands, and book author who regularly garnerspositive coveragein Chinese state media, The New York Times previously reported. Last week, she made another trip to China,this timeto the city of Wuxi, where she was invited to watch a drone show, promoted traditional crafts, and posed with a special Tesla model that comes indifferent colorwayssold only in Asia.</p><p>But in the US, Maye’s career has increasingly converged with Elon’s as her son gainedunprecedented powerand influence over the US federal government. Since President Trump won reelection, Maye has traveled on Air Force One, sat next to Melania Trump at a Mar-a-Lago dinner party, and attended a luncheon with Ivanka Trump, while also regularly firing off posts on X about US politics, according to a WIRED review of her social media presence.</p><p>In many ways, Maye appears to be trying to straddle the fine line between her political engagement in the US and her business dealings in China and other foreign countries. That endeavor has become more fraught over the past two months as Trump began radically reshaping US foreign policy, including imposing new tariffs on China. “There’s a heightened risk now for American business people traveling to China and that continues to increase, especially as tensions in the trade war will increase,” says Holden Triplett, cofounder of Trenchcoat Advisors and a former senior FBI official posted in Beijing.</p><p>Maye Musk’s business manager and Creative Artists Agency, her talent-representative agency in China, did not reply to requests for comment from WIRED.</p><p>Even before she began traveling regularly to China, Maye publicly supported Elon’s and Tesla’s business endeavors in the country. In 2015, she retweeted a post by Elon in which he mentioned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “Great trip to China seeing President Xi ... Pic w China team in state garden,” the tweet reads, which was later deleted from Elon’s profile.</p><p>Maye’s retweet, however, was still accessible at the time of publication. It’s a piece of largely overlooked evidence documenting Elon’s long business history in China and his relationship with the country’s government, which has attractedscrutiny from lawmakersas he took over thesocial media platform Xand began playing a central role in US politics. While many top American officials consider China a key foreign adversary, Musk has rarely criticized the country and relies on it as a major consumer market and manufacturing hub for Tesla.</p><p>Elon did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED about when or why he deleted the tweet as well as another seemingly from the same trip in which he said he was “very optimistic about Tesla’s long term future in China.” (Elon has deletedhundreds of tweetsover the years spanning many topics, according to the PolitTweet archive.)</p><p>Maye began building her own public image in China in late 2016 when she visited the country for the first time and spoke at an event hosted by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba. The company was promoting its global ecommerce fashion offerings and invited Maye, who it dubbed a “fashion legend,” to appear on stage with Alibaba’s then-chief marketing officer Chris Tung. That same year, a biography of Elon Musk written by Ashlee Vance was translated into Chinese, and people in China were eager to learn more about the tech entrepreneur’s mother.</p><p>But her career really kicked off in 2020 when her own biography,A Woman Makes a Plan, was also translated into Chinese. Around the same time, she registered accounts on the Chinese social media platforms Douyin and Weibo and held a virtual book talkwith Wendi Murdoch, the Chinese-born ex-wife of conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch. She also expressed interest in visiting China and Tesla’s factory in Shanghai, but noted the pandemic lockdowns were keeping her away.</p><p>Maye later modeled for Chinese brands looking to showcase their global appeal, including the Chinese smartphone giant OPPO and several fashion and beauty companies. In 2023, she went on a whirlwind book tour across China which included some events sponsored by a Chinese women’s underwear brand.</p><p>By early 2024, Maye was so in demand that she was going “to China nearly every month,” she said at a fashion show in February where shewalked the runwayfor a Chinese designer. Her trips, in turn,were celebratedby China’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs as a way to encourage more foreigners to visit the country.</p><p>While she usually emphasizes her career as a dietitian and book author, Maye’s China trips have also served as publicity events for Tesla. On that same 2023 tour, Maye visited Tesla’s Gigafactory in Shanghai and was featured ina video posted by Tesla, where she praised the “quality and the enthusiasm” she saw at the facility. (Last month, Tesla expanded its presence in Shanghai by opening a$200 millionbattery manufacturing plant in the city.) But Maye’s casual retweets and public support for Tesla’s global business turned into something much more dramatic this year.</p><p>As her son was getting more involved in American politics and becoming Donald Trump’s largest donor, Maye’s social media presence in the West also experienced a 180-degree transformation. Her X timeline made almost no mention of either the word “Democrat” or “Republican” until September of last year, but now she’s regularly endorsing Republican politicians and bashing the US media. In 2016, she tweeted about attending a Hillary Clinton fundraiser with the hashtag #ImWithHer and a New Yorker story titled “The Dangerous Acceptance of Donald Trump” but now appears in glitzy pictures taken at Trump rallies and Mar-a-Lago events.</p><p>Her Chinese social media, which lists an email associated with Creative Artists Agency China as her business contact, doesn't show any of that. The focus remains brand advertisements, book promotions, and festive holiday videos in which she wishes happy Chinese New Year to her Chinese fans while wearing traditional Chinese clothes. She rarely brings up politics when she’s traveling in China either.</p><p>Maye flew to China several days after the US presidential election in November, where she was asked during a panel event what she thought of the results and her son’s involvement. “He is dedicated to making America a wonderful country and to give us hope. And now we have hope,” Maye said, before brushing off a question about whether Elon is expected to take a role in the government, saying only that he “really likes rockets and cars.”</p><p>For now, Maye appears to be maintaining her relationships in China. On January 16, she was invited by China’s state-owned broadcaster to an event in New York City to celebrate the Chinese New Year during which the deputy head of China’s top propaganda department gave a speech. Maye was also interviewed and wore a white dress with a Chinese festive design that she said was “made specially for her.”</p><p>Four days later, she would appear at Trump’s inauguration party in Washington, DC, with her daughter in a long red dress with a crystal-embroidered brooch in the shape of a chrysanthemum. She would spend several nights partying with people like Trump’s health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and artificial intelligence and crypto adviser David Sacks. Photos from these parties, just like those from the numerous American political events that she has been to since October, are nowhere to be found on her Chinese social media.</p>

    <h1>Review: Vizio All-in-One Soundbar (SV210D-0806)</h1>

        <p>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.</p><p>8/10</p><p>How does Viziodo it? The company known for its value-packed home theater products may have fallen off the pace when it comes to thebest TVs, but Vizio soundbars continue to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to performance for your dollars. The brand’s latest All-in-One (AIO) budget soundbar may be its most obvious example right now of savvy sonic investment</p><p>One obvious way in which Vizio has maintained low prices ina tough marketis by cutting back on features. Instead of a physical remote, the AIO is controlled by Vizio’s reliable mobile app or your TV remote over HDMI ARC. The bar ditches most audio inputs, and in place of an LED display for EQ and volume adjustments, the onboard display was reduced to a single point of light.</p><p>Barebones options notwithstanding, the AIO provides styling as chic as you’ll find in its class and sound performance that’s reams abovewhat your TV can do alone. Considering it sails into port within shouting distance of $100 (and sometimes less on sale), it’s a pretty sweet package for anyone eyeing a sound upgrade with a minimal financial hit.</p><p>Vizio’s latest budget bar design looks a lot slicker than you might expect. The majority of the bar’s frame is covered in a dapper cloak of acoustic fabric. Where it does flash a little cheap plastic at the sides you'll find attractive bass ports. A Vizio logo and a few onboard controls are the only interruptions across the bar’s uniform 34-inch body, along with the lone display LED that shines through the fabric at the left. The AIO's 2.6-inch height makes sure it sits below most TV panels.</p><p>The bar looks nearly identical to Vizio’s “SE” AIO model it replaces, with only a couple of extra inches of width and some minor dimension changes noted on Vizio’s website. Like the SE, the current AIO employs just four drivers, including two 1.9 x 4-inch bass woofers and a stereo pair of 1.7 x 2.3-inch “full-range” drivers. As expected at this price, there are no upfiring drivers to create the height element for Dolby Atmos or DTS:X 3D audio formats. Otherwise, the minimal configuration recalls one of my favorite mini-bars, Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends).</p><p>Vizio All-in-One Soundbar (SV210D-0806)</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>The AIO does support decoding for both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, along with DTS Virtual:X, designed to create a sense of expansion for even stereo soundtracks via digital signal processing (DSP). Any virtualized 3D effects were minimal at best in my testing, but even baseline support for the two primary audio formats is a win at this price.</p><p>The AIO’s quick setup and simple operation make it a breeze to integrate into your TV room. You’ll first want to download the Vizio controller app shown in the quick-start menu. Next, connect the power and supplied HDMI cable between the bar and your TV’s HDMI ARC port, wait for the tone to add the bar in the app, and you should be in business. With just a single input and cable (along with a USB port that can play WAV files), there’s little chance for error. One drawback to the minimalist approach is that the AIO won’t connect to older TVs with a lone optical output.</p><p>Without a remote, Vizio's app takes on the heavy lifting. You’ll find two basic (and very similar) sound modes in Music and Movie, the latter of which adds a bit more zhuzh. Tapping the Personalize tab enables basic EQ adjustments, while effects like Night Mode and Virtual:X can be accessed under Advanced Audio. Your TV remote should automatically control volume and power, though some older TVs may require turning on “CEC” in the TV settings. Some newer Vizio TVs let you access Vizio soundbar settings from the TV menu directly and/or attach the bar below the TV with Vizio’s QuickFit mount system.</p><p>The AIO offers streaming over Bluetooth 5.3, accessible by tapping the Bluetooth symbol in the app or on the bar itself and then selecting it in your phone’s Bluetooth settings. Once paired, you can wake the bar to stream audio by swapping from the TV input to Bluetooth in the app. That’s handy since the AIO’s lack of Wi-Fi support leaves out fancier streaming options like Spotify Connect or Apple AirPlay.</p><p>When it comes to sound performance, the AIO packs a wallop. I was unprepared for how much dynamism and general punch it brings to the table for its size, especially during action scenes or dramatic moments where the sonic tension ratchets up. Bass is thumpy for a system without a separate subwoofer. High-register effects like strings and horns get loud and full, instantly adding more gravitas and verve to intense moments than your TV alone. All of this had me estimating the AIO’s cost at around $200 to $250 before I checked the price tag.</p><p>Vizio All-in-One Soundbar (SV210D-0806)</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>The bar also does a good job with more basic content like sitcoms or news, avoiding the kind of tinny dialog and whiny effects that often plague cheaper soundbars. Detail is solid and steps up accordingly for more nuanced mixes in prestige programming likeSeverance.Watching the season finale over the weekend, I was fully immersed in the moment, occasionally marveling at the bar’s ability to punch up the drama or add some lyricism to the retro soundtrack.</p><p>Music is well balanced, with some good thump down low and a warm and full touch to midrange instruments like guitar, drums, and vocals. The treble can sometimes come off a bit tinselly in sharper instruments like cymbals, and you won’t find the kind of fidelity that will have you reveling in the moment, but it’s perfectly pleasant for basic streaming.</p><p>The AIO's most notable struggles in over a week of testing were in its transitions between quiet dialog and bombastic moments like explosions or buzzing helicopters. This sometimes forced me to ramp up softer scenes and then quiet things down when the action struck. The Tru Volume is a solution, but it flatlines all dynamics, taking away from the AIO’s signature potency. As I noted in mySE Elevate Review, the Clear Dialog feature doesn't seem to do anything, but backing down the bass and treble a bit evened things out some, and most quality film and TV mixes sounded good with minimal futzing.</p><p>At this price, all you’re really targeting is a notable step up from your TV audio, and the AIO provides that and more. For the price of a midrangeportable Bluetooth speaker, you’re getting sizzling force, solid detail, and good balance across frequencies for everything you play. You can get more by jumping up toYamaha’s aging CR-20Aor even Vizio's olderM-series AIO, which can often be found on sale while available. Otherwise, if you’re looking to ramp up your TV time on a very thin budget, the latest AIO is one of thebest soundbarsyou'll find.</p><p>Vizio All-in-One Soundbar (SV210D-0806)</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p>

    <h1>I Put Nvidia’s RTX 50-Series Laptop GPU to the Test. Here’s What I Found</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 27, 2025</span>
    </div>
    <div class="article-content">
        <p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>Two months after the anticipateddesktop RTX 5090andRTX 5080, the next phase of Nvidia's next-gen graphics card lineup is finally here. I tried out the RTX 5090 mobile onboard the newRazer Blade 16, and while I'll have broader thoughts on the machine soon in a review, I first want to focus on how the RTX 5090 itself feels ona gaming laptop.</p><p>Nvidia's RTX 50 series has some interesting advances over the preceding RTX 40 series. The open approach to multi-frame generation, which uses artificial intelligence to generate additional frames to offer higher frame rates when gaming, has been fun to tweak. The extra VRAM in these cards is important in delivering smoother graphics too. But the increase in raw graphics performance is disappointingly small, and for a flagship GPU launching an entirely new architecture at thepeak of Nvidia's power, it left me wishing there was more on offer.</p><p>Nvidia did provide some caveats when handing over a Razer Blade 16 to test. It's a thinner model than previous years—likely one of the thinnest gaming laptops with an RTX 5090 at the least. Razer had to shave off an extra 15 watts of total graphics power (TGP) to get it this tiny, meaning this laptop isn't the best showcase for the 5090's maximum performance. That said, Nvidia is no doubt proud to show off an RTX 5090 in a chassis that's just 0.59 inches at its thinnest. The Blade also uses theRyzen AI 9 HX 370 CPUinstead of the beefier Intel chip in last year’s model.</p><p>But we're about to be inundated withgaming laptopswith graphics cards up to the RTX 5090. Unlike theRTX 5090 desktop GPU, it won't be sold out and impossible to find at a decent price. Speaking of, it's important to know that although it shares a name, the laptop version of the RTX 5090 doesn't sit in the same category as the corresponding desktop GPU. Instead, it's built on the same GPU (GB203) as the desktop RTX 5080. The mismatched naming has been used for the past few generations, despite the confusion it creates.</p><p>One important change this year is that the laptop RTX 5090 comes with 24 GB of video random access memory (VRAM), sliding right between the two desktop GPUs in memory capacity. VRAM stores graphics data, and the more you have available, the smoother the graphics. This is the most VRAM we've ever seen on a laptop, even more than what you get in the $999RTX 5080 desktop GPU. Given how sensitive newer games are to RAM usage these days, this should expand what’s possible and address one of the major complaints about the desktop RTX 5080.</p><p>In 3DMark tests, the mobile RTX 5090 lands just ahead of the desktop RTX 4070 Super, released at the beginning of 2024. Disappointingly, it doesn’t even offer a clear step up over 2023’s mobile RTX 4090. The extra memory will help quite a bit in specific games, but in all my 3DMark benchmarks, the RTX 5090 doesn’t have a clear victory over its predecessor.</p><p>But we live in strange times. With the RTX 5090, the primary question is not how good the raw performance is, but whether or not multi-frame generation lives up to the hype. As part of Deep Learning Super Sampling 4 (DLSS), it’s the primary feature Nvidia is selling the 50-series cards on, boasting that you can get RTX 4090 performance on a $1,300 laptop. Is that true? We might not know until the budget-tier mobile GPUs come out, but all the technology is in place to try it out on the RTX 5090 that’s now available.</p><p>Frame generation was a big deal when it launched in DLSS 3. Using predictive AI, DLSS can generate an artificial frame between every two rendered frames, greatly improving frame rates, powered by the GPU’s new Tensor cores. Multi-frame generation takes things a step further, letting you generate two or even three artificial frames for every two rendered frames. Nvidia says that equates to up to eight times the performance.</p><p>As has often been true with DLSS, performance comes at a price in visual quality. Put simply, the more fake frames you add, especially to much lower frame rates, the more the image quality degrades. Frame generation works as promised, and when you stare at just the numbers, it’s impressive. If you are after those higher frame rate numbers, adding new frames to the game improves smoothness for sure, though maybe not to the degree you might expect. Generated frames don't feel the same as native ones. The numbers get bigger as promised, but the more extra frames you add, the more input lag is inserted into the equation.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077is the most noteworthy example right now, hyped up for its all-inray tracing featuresand native implementation of multi-frame generation. I tested the game on the Blade 16’s native 2,560 x 1,600-pixel resolution in the Ray Tracing Overdrive mode, tweaking the multi-frame generation as I went. In 2X multi-frame generation mode under the Quality setting, the RTX 5090 averaged 82 frames per second (fps). That jumped up to 115 fps in the 3X mode, making better use of the240-Hz screen refresh rateon the Razer Blade 16.</p><p>You can get even more juice from frame generation by changing DLSS to the Performance setting. In the past, I would have never recommended such a thing. But with DLSS 4, there have been huge improvements to image quality with the new Transformer model. It’s exposed as a toggle inCyberpunk 2077(unlike in other games), so you can compare screenshots side by side to see the difference. Shadows are more realistic, text looks sharper, and there are fewer AI artifacts and oversharpening.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong—the changes overall are still subtle. If you’re familiar with DLSS, you know that even in its new iterations, image quality can suffer, especially if you venture outside of Quality mode. Let your eyes wander toward the edges of the frame or to objects in the distance, and you’ll see garbled text, warped edges, and low-resolution textures. It’s not perfect, but the Transformer model polishes most of these errors.</p><p>That’s just one game. I also testedIndiana Jones and The Great Circle,Star Wars Outlaws,Black Myth: Wukong, andMarvel Rivals. Except forWukong, these games also had native implementations of DLSS 4, but remain some of the select few.</p><p>Nvidia has a way around the limited number of games that support it. In the Nvidia app, you can override a game’s settings to support 2X, 3X, or 4X frame generation. That’s how Nvidia achieves its claim of over 100 supported games and apps. While that works for testing, it’s incredibly cumbersome to use. The amount of frame generation you want to use will depend on the game, requiring multiple restarts until you’re happy with the result. Hopefully, this buys time for developers to add the setting in games, but for now, I don’t think it’s something many gamers will use.</p><p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circlewas the most convincing example of DLSS 4. While you can playCyberpunk 2077maxed out with standard 2X frame generation at decent frame rates, things are even better withThe Great Circle.You’ll average only around 60 fps in Supreme mode with full path-traced lighting effects, and without frame generation at all, you’re in the 40s. The 3X or 4X gets you that buttery frame-rate gaming experience without turning down ray tracing.</p><p>Artificially adding frames is less useful if you primarily play fast-paced competitive games likeMarvel Rivals. You might assume that higher frame rates—even if they’re artificially generated—mean smoother action. The game mightlookbetter, but as any competitive player will tell you, the trade-off in input delay just isn’t worth it. The input delay is noticeable in slower-paced games but doesn't impact gameplay nearly as much.</p><p>That said, I don’t mind that Nvidia has opened the sandbox and is allowing gamers to tweak settings using the override functionality in the Nvidia app. More options and customization to suit your PC, budget, and specific game are what PC gaming is all about, after all. I just wish this card had more raw compute to back up multi-frame generation.</p><p>Most of what I’ve said applies equally to desktop GPUs as it does to laptops. But Nvidia also boasts the heightened efficiency of the RTX 5090 to help with battery life.Max-Qis Nvidia’s tech to improve efficiency and battery life, and there are a few key optimizations, like voltage for the GDDR7 memory, and a new Low Latency Sleep feature to turn off the GPU faster.</p><p>Nvidia is promising up to an extra hour of battery life while gaming. I can’t do a one-for-one comparison with an exact previous model, but I tried out Balanced mode on battery, which quieted down the system a bit yet gave the laptop enough power to produce a smooth enough 60 fps inMarvel Rivals. I was surprised by how well the system balanced noise, heat, performance, and battery, but I still only got around an hour and a half of playtime before it died. That’s a step in the right direction, though I wouldn’t say it’s game-changing.</p><p>A lot more can be said about these individual laptops as they launch. These top-of-the-line models should only be reserved for people interested in experiencing the best ray tracing in the latest titles. The broader support for multi-frame generation may be more useful on the lower-tier laptops when they come out later this year, offering a better gaming experience without paying a premium. Larger systems may be able to take full advantage of what the RTX 5090 can offer.</p><p>But tested in a thin laptop like the Razer Blade 16, the mobile RTX 5090 doesn’t quite feel like the next-gen GPU refresh it should be.</p>

    <h1>Review: Manta Sound Sleep Mask</h1>

        <p>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.</p><p>8/10</p><p>I’ve always beenenvious of people who can fall asleep easily. For me personally, I struggle to turn my brain off. I’m always readjusting my blankets and flipping my pillow and tossing and turning. I need a box fan, a completely dark environment, and the complete elimination of distractions. Heaven forbid someone near me is snoring—nothing triggers mymisophoniafaster.</p><p>The Manta Sound Sleep Mask has been a complete game changer for me and my sleep routine.</p><p>At first glance, it looks as if a traditional sleep mask had a baby with a visor one of the X-Men would wear. It comes in black, pink, or light gray, and there are a few different parts. There’s the eye mask strap, which has C-shaped eye cups that can be removed and readjusted via a hook-and-loop system. Those eye cups create a complete blackout environment without putting pressure on your eyes—something I appreciate a lot since I’m exclusively a side sleeper. The second strap encases super-thin Bluetooth headphones. They’re about the thickness of a thin yoga mat and are nearly imperceptible when you’re wearing the mask. Each headphone can be adjusted forward or backward using the tabs on the outside. And on the outside of the headphone strap, there are three buttons—they’re basically centered on your forehead when you’re wearing the mask. Two of them are volume controls, and one is the power button. The whole package is simple but effective, and ithelps me fall asleepand stay asleep every single time I use it.</p><p>The mask is unique since it covers both your eyes and ears. Unlike some other eye masks, even if you wear it tightly, it won’t create pressure on your eyes in order to block out all the light. I’ve successfully used it many times in direct sunlight. It’s the equivalent of throwing a sheet over my birdcage—the sun goes away, and my brain knows it’s time to go to sleep.</p><p>Manta Sound Sleep Mask</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>The Bluetooth headphones, too, are nothing to sneeze at. They’re easy to pair with your phone and while they don’t have mind-blowing quality or active noise cancellation, they do get loud enough to drown out any environment. There are 30 steps of volume control, so you can dial in the audio precisely. I‘ve used the Manta Sound to fall asleep in a tent at many music festivals, both in the dead of summer and on 30-degree Fahrenheit nights. Even with world-renowned bass being sound-checked at 10 am and my neighbors starting their pregame at the crack of dawn, I slept like a baby, the sounds of a box fan being piped directly into my ears. Or in a hotel room, while my friends chatted, watched TV, and played music on a speaker, I was blissfully unaware and fully asleep. This would be impossible for me without the Manta Sound (believe me when I say I have tried other methods). The battery lasts for 20 hours and charges via USB-C, and I’ve never had the headphones disconnect from my phone on their own. The battery automatically shuts off after 30 minutes of no audio streaming. The mask also has a built-in microphone to take phone calls, but I’ve never used that feature. My phone only rings while on “Do Not Disturb” for a very few number of people, in which case I pop the mask off and answer normally.</p><p>The flip side of this immersion is that I sometimes find myself sleepingtoosoundly. I frequently wake up disoriented after using the Manta Sound, wondering what year it is once I wake up. And it freaks me out a bit to be so far removed from the world. With my eyes and ears completely covered, I have no idea what’s going on around me. If I went to festivals solo, for example, I might not use this mask, since I’d be completely unaware of any weather events or people walking through my campsite. But that immersion is ideal in some instances—I would’ve killed for this mask when I worked third shift and was frequently woken up by birds, lawnmowers, or the godforsaken sun. The Manta Sound is like blackout curtains for your brain.</p><p>I’ve tried other sleep solutions before, to varying degrees of effectiveness. Ear plugs and sleep headphones tend to not jibe with my preferred sleeping style, also known as “spinning around like a rotisserie chicken until I find exactly the right spot.” And even other eye masks have been historically difficult to get adjusted so they sit correctly without pulling my hair or pressing awkwardly on my head. This mask eliminates those issues. There’s nothing jammed in or falling out of my ear canal, and there’s no pressure squashing my eyes or nose. And though those other solutions might be cheaper, depending on what you use, I think it’s worth the extra price to get a product that helps you sleep without disrupting or disturbing you. The Manta Sound just works.</p><p>Manta Sound Sleep Mask</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>The Manta Sound is fully adjustable for a custom and comfortable fit. You can move the eye cups, tighten and loosen both straps, and tighten the mask diagonally so it stays put. Once you find the Goldilocks zone, it stays throughout the night and doesn’t ride up or slide down. But those adjustments can be finicky. Sometimes I get the eye strap just right, and then I struggle to tighten the headphone strap on top. And the hook-and-loop closure can be a little noisy if you’re adjusting it. But I think the trade-off is well worth it, and I’ve always managed to find the right fit for me.</p><p>Another minor gripe I have is that I can’t precisely control my audio with the mask on. The buttons don’t work to move ahead or repeat a song. It’s totally fine—I can set a sleep timer on Spotify or use Siri in a pinch. But sometimes I’ve had to peek my eye out to adjust my audio playback, and it is a factor that you might care about if you’re used to headphones with more onboard controls. And some people might be turned off by the fact that a phone or some other audio source is required—which means potentially draining your phone battery, and needing to have music downloaded or service to stream it.</p><p>All in all, though, I love this mask. It’s breathable, and I can play the Sleep With Me podcast or random ambient noise without disturbing my partner. The inner strap and eye cups are both machine washable (the outside layer should be spot-cleaned). The included carrying case even doubles as a laundry bag. Every part is durable. And most important, it helps me fall asleep and stay asleep, no matter where I’m at or what’s going on around me. If you struggle to sleep well, the Manta Sound is worth every penny.</p><p>Manta Sound Sleep Mask</p><p>Rating: 8/10</p><p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p>

    <h1>I Opted Out of AI Training. Does This Reduce My Future Influence?</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 27, 2025</span>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>If we all start opting out of our posts being used for training models, doesn't that reduce the influence of our unique voice and perspectives on those models? Increasingly, the models will be everyone's primary window into the rest of the world. It seems like the people who care the least about these things will be the ones with the most data that ends up training the models' default behavior.</p><p>—Data Influencer</p><p>Honestly, it’s frustrating to me that users of the internet are forced to opt out ofartificial intelligencetraining as the default. Wouldn’t it be nice if affirmative consent was the norm for generative AI companies as theyscrape the weband any other data repositories they can find to build increasingly larger and larger frontier models?</p><p>But, unfortunately, that’s not the case. Companies likeOpenAIandGoogleargue that iffair use accessto all this data was taken away from them, then none of this technology would even be possible. For now, users who don’t want to contribute to the generative models are stuck with a morass of opt-out processes across different websites and social media platforms.</p><p>Even if the current bubble surrounding generative AI does pop, much like thedotcom bubbledid after a few years, the models that power all of these new AI tools won’t go extinct. So, the ghosts of your niche forum posts and social media threads advocating for strongly held convictions will live on inside the software tools. You’re right that opting out means actively attempting not to be included in a potentially long-lasting piece of culture.</p><p>To address your question directly and realistically, theseopt-out processesare basically futile in their current state. Those who opt out right now are still influencing the model. Let’s say you fill out a form for a social media site to not use or sell your data for AI training. Even if that platform respects that request, there are countless startups in Silicon Valley with plucky 19-year-olds who won’t think twice about scraping the data posted to that platform, even if they aren’t technically supposed to. As a general rule, you can assume that anything you’ve ever posted online has likely made it into multiple generative models.</p><p>OK, but let’s say you could realistically block your data from these systems or demand it be removed after the fact, would doing so lessen your voice or impact on theAI tools? I’ve been thinking about this question for a few days, and I’m still torn.</p><p>On one hand, your singular information is just an infinitesimally small contribution to the vastness of the dataset, so your voice, as a nonpublic figure or author, likely isn’t nudging the model one way or another.</p><p>From this perspective your data is just another brick in the wall of a 1,000-story building. And it’s worth remembering that data collection is just the first step in creating an AI model. Researchers spend months fine-tuning the software to get the results they desire, sometimes relying onlow-wage workersto label datasets and gauge the output quality for refinement. These steps may further abstract data and lessen your individual impact.</p><p>On the opposite end, what if we compared this to voting in an election? Millions of votes are cast in American presidential elections, yet most citizens and defenders of democracy insist that every vote matters—with a constant refrain of “make your voice heard.” It’s not a perfect metaphor, but what if we saw our data as having a similar impact? A small whisper among the cacophony of noise, but still impactful on the AI model’s output.</p><p>I’m not fully convinced of this argument, but I also don’t think this perspective should be dismissed outright. Especially for subject matter experts, your distinct insights and way of approaching information is uniquely valuable to the AI researchers. Meta wouldn’t have gone through the trouble of usingall those booksin its new AI model if any old data would do the trick.</p><p>Looking toward the future, the true impact your data could have on these models will likely be to inspire“synthetic” data. As the companies who make generative AI systems run out of quality information to scrape, they will enter their ouroboros era; they’ll start using generative AI to replicate human data that they will then feed back into the system to train the next AI model to better replicate human responses. As long as generative AI exists, just remember that you, as a human, will always be a small part of the machine—whether you want to be or not.</p>

    <h1>Hikaru Utada Would Rather Play CERN Than Coachella</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 27, 2025</span>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>Schrödinger’s cat, quantumentanglement—the songs on Hikaru Utada’s latest album,Science Fiction, go deeper into the singer-songwriter’s “fascination with science” than they ever have before. Part greatest-hits collection, part reflection on interests they have cultivated for many years, it’s a body of work that shows their breadth as an artist. It only seemed fitting, then, that WIRED Japan would invite Utada to Switzerland to visitCERN, one of the world’s leading research centers for particle physics, an invitation they quickly accepted.</p><p>“CERN is a place I have dreamed of visiting for the past 10 years or so,” Utada says. “To be honest, being able to go there and talk to the scientists and see the particle accelerator might be even better than performing on the main stage at Coachella [laughs]. I definitely wanted to go.”</p><p>CERN is the world’s largest particle physics laboratory, located on the border between Switzerland and France. Its iconic Large Hadron Collider (LHC)—a gigantic circular accelerator with a circumference of 27 kilometers—made its name in 2012 when it discovered theHiggs boson, the mysterious particle that continues to play a key role in experiments into the origins of the universe.</p><p>The center’s work is not limited to research about how the universe began and the behavior of subatomic particles; it can also lead to advances that have greater impacts on everyday life. For example, in 1989,Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist who was then working at CERN, developed a system to provide decentralized, real-time access to information within the organization. It became the foundation for the World Wide Web.</p><p>Hikaru Utada explores ATLAS, a large general-purpose particle detector located 100 meters underground on the CERN main campus, which detects and measures particles accelerated and collided by the Large Hadron Collider.</p><p>In recent years, the organization has also been proactively engaged in outreach efforts that fuse art and science. That’s why University of Tokyo physicist Junichi Tanaka and Kazuki Kojima, a researcher at KEK (High Energy Accelerator Research Organization) are here. CERN asked the Japanese scientists to accompany Utada and WIRED on our CERN visit. Utada asked the two of them more questions than anyone else. While standing in front of ATLAS (the large general-purpose particle detector located 100 meters under the main CERN campus that detects and measures particles accelerated and collided by the LHC), the conversation around the topic of dark matter was a lively one.</p><p>Utada: What are you most focused on pursuing at the moment?</p><p>Kojima:There is a theory in particle physics called the Standard Model, but it can only explain about 5 percent of the mass and energy in the universe. In fact, it is thought that about 26 percent of the mass and energy in the universe is dark matter, and the remaining 70 percent is dark energy. Regardless of dark energy, we know that dark matter exists, but we don't know what it is, and we are currently searching to understand its true nature.</p><p>Utada:Dark energy is …</p><p>Kojima:We know almost nothing about it.</p><p>Tanaka:You could say it’s a name that was almost given at random.</p><p>Utada:OK, so “dark” here doesn’t mean “not lit,” but rather “unknowable” or “unknown.”</p><p>Tanaka:We don’t know anything about dark energy. It has that name because the universe is expanding. But dark matter can be explained by gravity, so we believe it exists. But it’s hard to find it. We’re trying to measure something when we don't know what it is, so we spend a great deal of time conducting experiments.</p><p>Utada:It’s like proving the existence of something by the absence of something else.</p><p>Kojima:Yes, that’s right.</p><p>Utada:It’s like trying to prove the existence of an invisible man. A room with capacity for 10 people is packed even though there are only nine people there. Or there were 10 people in the room, but traces of 11 people coming from it.</p><p>TanakaYes, yes, that’s the idea!</p><p>Utada explores CERN.</p><p>It’s a matter of making an analogy to something else or replacing one relationship with another. Utada says they attach a special importance to this act. This means that they regularly transform what exists only in their own mind into clever metaphors by making full use of the knowledge and experience they have cultivated over time, and the words and symbols derived from their intuition. They then diligently carry out the task of communicating these to others.</p><p>“When I compared dark matter to an invisible man, I was really happy to hear Tanaka and Kojima say, ‘Oh, that's right!’” Utada says.</p><p>Another thing that made an impression on Utada was the pair’s response to their question about what they’d want to convey to the general public who are not experts in science. “Tanaka thought for a while and then said, ‘I guess it would be that there is still so much we don’t know.’ I thought that was really wonderful,” Utada says.</p><p>But it’s even deeper than that. “I think the ‘knowledge of ignorance,’ feeling truly excited by the fact that there are things we don’t yet know or don’t understand, is a very important perspective,” Utada says. “Fear comes from ignorance, doesn’t it? It is human instinct to fear the dark. It’s because we don’t know that we feel fear, discrimination, prejudice, violence, and more. So what is the opposite of that? I think it’s curiosity and a spirit of inquiry.”</p><p>The songs on Hikaru Utada’s new albumScience Fictiongo deep into the singer-songwriter’s “fascination with science.”</p><p>This story is an excerpt of a piece fromWIREDJapan's Quantumpedia March issue.</p><p>Special thanks to: Presence Switzerland (Federal Department of Foreign Affairs), embassy of Switzerland in Japan, Switzerland tourism, CERN, Geneva tourism, hotel president Wilson Junichi Tanaka (The University of Tokyo), Kazuki Kojima (KEK), Masato Aoki (KEK), Tomoyuki Saito (The University of Tokyo), Nozomu Kaji (Sony Music Labels, Inc.), Mina Okachi (Sony Music Labels, Inc.), Akihico Mori styling by Kyohei Ogawa, hair and makeup by Hisano Komine, project coordination by Erina Anscomb.</p>

    <h1>Inside arXiv—the Most Transformative Platform in All of Science</h1>
    <div class="article-meta">
        <span class="source">Wired</span>
        <span class="date">March 27, 2025</span>

    <div class="article-content">
        <p>“Just when Ithought I was out, they pull me back in!” With a sly grin that I’d soon come to recognize, Paul Ginsparg quoted Michael Corleone fromThe Godfather. Ginsparg, a physics professor at Cornell University and a certified MacArthur genius, may have little in common with Al Pacino’s mafia don, but both are united by the feeling that they were denied a graceful exit from what they’ve built.</p><p>Nearly 35 years ago, Ginsparg createdarXiv, a digital repository where researchers could share their latest findings—before those findings had been systematically reviewed or verified. Visit arXiv.org today (it’s pronounced like “archive”) and you’ll still see its old-school Web 1.0 design, featuring a red banner and the seal of Cornell University, the platform’s institutional home. But arXiv’s unassuming facade belies the tectonic reconfiguration it set off in thescientific community. If arXiv were to stop functioning, scientists from every corner of the planet would suffer an immediate and profound disruption. “Everybody in math and physics uses it,” Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. “I scan it every night.”</p><p>Every industry has certain problems universally acknowledged as broken: insurance in health care, licensing in music, standardized testing in education, tipping in the restaurant business. In academia, it’s publishing. Academic publishing is dominated by for-profit giants like Elsevier and Springer. Calling their practice a form of thuggery isn’t so much an insult as an economic observation. Imagine if a book publisher demanded that authors write books for free and, instead of employing in-house editors, relied on other authors to edit those books, also for free. And not only that: The final product was then sold at prohibitively expensive prices to ordinary readers, and institutions were forced to pay exorbitant fees for access.</p><p>The “free editing” academic publishers facilitate is called peer review, the process by which fellow researchers vet new findings. This can take months, even a year. But with arXiv, scientists could post their papers—known, at this unvetted stage, as preprints—for instant and free access to everyone. One of arXiv’s great achievements was “showing that you could divorce the actual transmission of your results from the process of refereeing,” said Paul Fendley, an early arXiv moderator and now a physicist at All Souls College, Oxford. During crises like the Covid pandemic, time-sensitive breakthroughs were disseminated quickly—particularly by bioRxiv and medRxiv, platforms inspired by arXiv—potentially saving,by one study’s estimate, millions of lives.</p><p>While arXiv submissions aren’t peer-reviewed, they are moderated by experts in each field, who volunteer their time to ensure that submissions meet basic academic standards and follow arXiv’s guidelines: original research only, no falsified data, sufficiently neutral language. Submissions also undergo automated checks for baseline quality control. Without these, pseudoscientific papers and amateur work would flood the platform.</p><p></p><p>In 2021, the journal Naturedeclared arXivone of the “10 computer codes that transformed science,” praising its role in fostering scientific collaboration. (The article is behind a paywall—unlock it for $199 a year.) By a recent count, arXiv hosts more than 2.6 million papers, receives 20,000 new submissions each month, and has 5 million monthly active users. Many of the most significant discoveries of the 21st century have first appeared on the platform. The “transformers” paper thatlaunched the modern AI boom? Uploaded to arXiv. Same with the solution to the Poincaré conjecture, one of the seven Millennium Prize problems, famous for their difficulty and $1 million rewards. Just because a paper is posted on arXiv doesn’t mean it won’t appear in a prestigious journal someday, but it’s often where research makes its debut and stays openly available. The transformers paper is still routinely accessed via arXiv.</p><p>For scientists, imagining a world without arXiv is like the rest of us imagining one without public libraries or GPS. But a look at its inner workings reveals that it isn’t a frictionless utopia of open-access knowledge. Over the years, arXiv’s permanence has been threatened by everything from bureaucratic strife to outdated code to even, once, a spy scandal. In the words of Ginsparg, who usually redirects interview requests to anFAQ document—on arXiv, no less—and tried to talk me out of visiting him in person, arXiv is “a child I sent off to college but who keeps coming back to camp out in my living room, behaving badly.”</p><p>Ginsparg and Imet over the course of several days last spring in Ithaca, New York, home of Cornell University. I’ll admit, I was apprehensive ahead of our time together. Geoffrey West, a former supervisor of Ginsparg’s at Los Alamos National Laboratory, once described him as “quite a character” who is “infamous in the community” for being “quite difficult.” He also said he was “extremely funny” and a “great guy.” In our early email exchanges, Ginsparg told me, upfront, that stories about arXiv never impress him: “So many articles, so few insights,” he wrote.</p><p>Ginsparg in his physics office at Cornell University.</p><p>At 69 years old, Ginsparg has the lean build of a retired triathlete, his knees etched with scars collected over a lifetime of hiking, mountain climbing, and cycling. (He still leads hikes on occasion, leaving younger scientists struggling to keep up.) His attire was always relaxed, as though he’d just stepped off the Camino de Santiago, making my already casual clothes seem overdressy. Much of our time together was spent cycling the town’s rolling hills, and the maximum speed on the ebike I rented could not keep up with his efficient pedaling.</p><p>Invited one afternoon to Ginsparg’s office in Cornell’s physics building, I discovered it to be not “messy,” per se, because that suggests it could be cleaned. Instead, the objects in the room seemed inert, long since resigned to their fate: unopened boxes from the 1990s, piles of Physics Today magazines, an inexplicable CRT monitor, a tossed-aside invitation to the Obama White House. New items were occasionally added to the heap. I spotted a copy of Stephen Wolfram’s recent book,The Second Law, with a note from Wolfram that read, “Since you can’t find it on arXiv :)” The only thing that seemed actively in use was the blackboard, dense with symbols and equations related to quantum measurement theory, sprawling with bra-ket notation.</p><p>As he showed me around the building and his usual haunts, Ginsparg was gregarious, not letting a single detail slip by: the nesting patterns of local red-tailed hawks, the comings and goings of the dining staff, the plans for a new building going up behind his office. He was playful, even prankish. Midway through telling me about a podcast he was listening to, Ginsparg suddenly stopped and said, “I like your hair color, by the way, it works for you”—my hair is dyed ash gray, if anyone cares—before seamlessly transitioning to a story about a hard drive that had failed him.</p><p>The drive, which he had sent for recovery, contained a language model, Ginsparg’s latest intellectual fascination. Among his litany of peeves is that, because arXiv has seen a surge in submissions in recent times, especially in the AI category, the number of low-quality papers has followed a similar curve—and arXiv has nowhere near enough volunteers to vet them all. Hence his fussing with the drive, part of a quest to catch subpar submissions with what he calls “the holy grail crackpot filter.” And Ginsparg thinks, as he often has in arXiv’s three-decade history, that the quality would not be up to snuff if he doesn’t do it himself.</p><p>Long before arXivbecame critical infrastructure for scientific research, it was a collection of shell scripts running on Ginsparg’s NeXT machine. In June 1991, Ginsparg, then a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, attended a conference in Colorado, where a fateful encounter took place.</p><p>First came a remark from Joanne Cohn, a friend of Ginsparg’s and a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, who maintained a mailing list for physics preprints. At the time, there was no centralized way to access these preprints. Unless researchers were on certain mailing lists—which were predicated on their affiliations with prestigious institutions—or knew exactly whom to contact via email, they had to wait months to read new work in published journals.</p><p>Then came an offhand comment from a physicist worried about his computer’s storage filling up with emailed articles while he was traveling.</p><p>Ginsparg, who had been coding since high school, asked Cohn if she’d considered automating the distribution process. She hadn’t and told him to go ahead and do it himself. “My recollection is that the next day he’d come up with the scripts and seemed pretty happy about having done it so quickly,” Cohn told me. “It’s hard to communicate how different it was at the time. Paul had really seen ahead.”</p><p>Hearing tales from and about Ginsparg, you can’t help but see him as a sort of Forrest Gump figure of the internet age, who found himself at crucial junctures and crossed paths with revolutionary figures. As an undergrad at Harvard, he was classmates with Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer; his older brother was a graduate student at Stanford studying with Terry Winograd, an AI pioneer. The brothers both had email addresses and access to Arpanet, the precursor to the internet, at a time when few others did.</p><p>Ginsparg replaced his MacBook’s DC-in board himself.</p><p>After earning his PhD in theoretical physics at Cornell, Ginsparg began teaching at Harvard. A career there wasn’t to be: He wasn’t granted tenure—Harvard is infamous for this—and started looking for a job elsewhere. That’s when Ginsparg was recruited to Los Alamos, where he was free to do research on theoretical high-energy physics full-time, without other responsibilities. Plus, New Mexico was perfect for his active lifestyle.</p><p>When arXiv started, it wasn’t a website but an automated email server (and within a few months also an FTP server). Then Ginsparg heard about something called the “World Wide Web.” Initially skeptical—“I can’t really pay attention to every single fad”—he became intrigued when the Mosaic browser was released in 1993. Soon after, Ginsparg built a web interface for arXiv, which over time became its primary mode of access. He also occasionally consulted with a programmer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) named Tim Berners-Lee—now Sir Tim “Inventor of the World Wide Web” Berners-Lee—whom Ginsparg fondly credits with grilling excellent swordfish at his home in the French countryside.</p><p>In 1994, with a National Science Foundation grant, Ginsparg hired two people to transform arXiv’s shell scripts into more reliable Perl code. They were both technically gifted, perhapstoogifted to stay for long. One of them, Mark Doyle, later joined the American Physical Society and became its chief information officer. The other, Rob Hartill, was working simultaneously on a project to collect entertainment data: the Internet Movie Database. (After IMDb, Hartill went on to do notable work at the Apache Software Foundation.)</p><p>Before arXiv was called arXiv, it was accessed under the hostname xxx.lanl.gov (“xxx” didn’t have the explicit connotations it does today, Ginsparg emphasized). During a car ride, he and his wife brainstormed nicer-sounding names. Archive? Already taken. Maybe they could sub in the Greek equivalent of X, chi (pronounced like “kai”). “She wrote it down and crossed out theeto make it more symmetric around theX,” Ginsparg said. “So arXiv it was.” At this point, there wasn’t much formal structure. The number of developers typically stayed at one or two, and much of the moderation was managed by Ginsparg’s friends, acquaintances, and colleagues.</p><p>Early on, Ginsparg expected to receive on the order of 100 submissions to arXiv a year. It turned out to be closer to 100 a month, and growing. “Day one, something happened, day two something happened, day three, Ed Witten posted a paper,” as Ginsparg once put it. “That was when the entire community joined.” Edward Witten is a revered string theorist and, quite possibly, the smartest person alive. “The arXiv enabled much more rapid worldwide communication among physicists,” Witten wrote to me in an email. Over time, disciplines such as mathematics and computer science were added, and Ginsparg began to appreciate the significance of this new electronic medium. Plus, he said, “it was fun.”</p><p>As the usage grew, arXiv faced challenges similar to those of other large software systems, particularly in scaling and moderation. There were slowdowns to deal with, like the time arXiv was hit by too much traffic from “stanford.edu.” The culprits? Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who were then busy indexing the web for what would eventually become Google. Years later, when Ginsparg visited Google HQ, both Brin and Page personally apologized to him for the incident.</p><p>The biggest mysteryis not why arXiv succeeded. Rather, it’s how it wasn’t killed by vested interests intent on protecting traditional academic publishing. Perhaps this was due to a decision Ginsparg made early on: Upon submission, users signed a clause that gave arXiv nonexclusive license to distribute the work in perpetuity, even in the event of future publication elsewhere. The strategic move ensured that no major publishers, known for their typically aggressive actions to maintain feudal control, would ever seriously attempt to shut it down.</p><p>But even as arXiv’s influence grew, higher-ups at Los Alamos never particularly championed the project—which was becoming, one could argue, more influential than the lab itself. (This was, of course, long past the heyday of Oppenheimer depicted in Christopher Nolan’s middling 2023 docudrama.) Those early years at Los Alamos were “dreamlike and heavenly,” Ginsparg emphasized, the best job he ever had. But in 1999, a fellow physicist at the lab, Wen Ho Lee, was accused of leaking classified information to China. Lee, a Taiwanese American, was later cleared of wrongdoing, and the case was widely criticized for racial profiling. At the time, the scandal led to internal upheaval. There were travel restrictions to prevent leaks, and even discussions about subjecting employees to lie detector tests. “It just got glummer and glummer,” Ginsparg said. It didn’t help that a performance review that year labeled him “a strictly average performer” with “no particular computer skills contributing to lab programs.” Also, his daughter had just been born, and there weren’t schools nearby. He was ready to leave.</p><p>Ginsparg stops short of saying he “brought” arXiv with him, but the fact is, he ended up back at his alma mater, Cornell—tenured, this time—and so did arXiv. He vowed to be free of the project within “five years maximum.” After all, his main job wasn’t supposed to be running arXiv—it was teaching and doing research. At the university, arXiv found a home within the library. “They disseminate material to academics,” Ginsparg said, “so that seemed like a natural fit.”</p><p>A natural fit it was not. Under the hood, arXiv was a complex software platform that required technical expertise far beyond what was typically available in a university library. The logic for the submission process alone involved a vast number of potential scenarios and edge cases, making the code convoluted. Ginsparg and other early arXiv members I spoke to felt that the library failed to grasp arXiv’s significance and treated it more like an afterthought.</p><p>Ginsparg should really clean his keyboard.</p><p>On the library’s side, some people thought Ginsparg was too hands-on. Others said he wasn’t patient enough. A “good lower-level manager,” according to someone long involved with arXiv, “but his sense of management didn’t scale.” For most of the 2000s, arXiv couldn’t hold on to more than a few developers.</p><p>The string theorist’s first paper posted to arXiv. Witten’s early adoption helped legitimize the platform.</p><p>A real brain-breaker: Just as a hologram creates a three-dimensional image from a flat surface, everything inside a given space can be fully described by information on its two-dimensional boundary. Right?</p><p>When this “creationist” paper was rejected and Gentry’s access to arXiv revoked, he filed a lawsuit against the platform, claiming violation of constitutional rights.</p><p>With these, the Russian mathematician solved one of the seven Millennium Prize problems (the only one solved to date). He declined the $1 million prize and lives in seclusion.</p><p>In which word2vec—the verbal math that allows machines to understand words—was introduced. Around this time, computer science papers began to dominate arXiv.</p><p>The paper that launched a thousand chatbots.</p><p>A room-temp superconductor? Researchers worldwide attempted to reproduce the results but ultimately debunked the claim.</p><p>There are twopaths for pioneers of computing. One is a life of board seats, keynote speeches, and lucrative consulting gigs. The other is the path of the practitioner who remains hands-on, still writing and reviewing code. It’s clear where Ginsparg stands—and how anathema the other path is to him. As he put it to me, “Larry Summers spending one day a week consulting for some hedge fund—it’s just unseemly.”</p><p>But overstaying one’s welcome also risks unseemliness. By the mid-2000s, as the web matured, arXiv—in the words of its current program director, Stephanie Orphan—got “bigger than all of us.” A creationist physicist sued it for rejecting papers on creationist cosmology. Various other mini-scandals arose, including a plagiarism one, and some users complained that the moderators—volunteers who are experts in their respective fields—held too much power. In 2009, Philip Gibbs, an independent physicist, even created viXra (arXiv spelled backward), a more or less unregulated Wild West where papers on quantum-physico-homeopathy can find their readership, for anyone eager to learnwhy pi is a lie.</p><p>Then there was the problem of managing arXiv’s massive code base. Although Ginsparg was a capable programmer, he wasn’t a software professional adhering to industry norms like maintainability and testing. Much like constructing a building without proper structural supports or routine safety checks, his methods allowed for quick initial progress but later caused delays and complications. Unrepentant, Ginsparg often went behind the library’s back to check the code for errors. The staff saw this as an affront, accusing him of micromanaging and sowing distrust.</p><p>In 2011, arXiv’s 20th anniversary, Ginsparg thought he was ready to move on, writing what was intended as a farewell note, an article titled “ArXiv at 20,”in Nature: “For me, the repository was supposed to be a three-hour tour, not a life sentence. ArXiv was originally conceived to be fully automated, so as not to scuttle my research career. But daily administrative activities associated with running it can consume hours of every weekday, year-round without holiday.”</p><p>Ginsparg would stay on the advisory board, but daily operations would be handed over to the staff at the Cornell University Library.</p><p>It never happened, and as time went on, some accused Ginsparg of “backseat driving.” One person said he was holding certain code “hostage” by refusing to share it with other employees or on GitHub. Ginsparg was frustrated because he couldn’t understand why implementing features that used to take him a day now took weeks. I challenged him on this, asking if there was any documentation for developers to onboard the new code base. Ginsparg responded, “I learned Fortran in the 1960s, and real programmers didn’t document,” which nearly sent me, a coder, into cardiac arrest.</p><p>Technical problems were compounded by administrative ones. In 2019, Cornell transferred arXiv to the school’s Computing and Information Science division, only to have it change hands again after a few months. Then a new director with a background in, of all things, for-profit academic publishing took over; she lasted a year and a half. “There was disruption,” said an arXiv employee. “It was not a good period.”</p><p>But finally, relief: In 2022, the Simons Foundation committed funding that allowed arXiv to go on a hiring spree. Ramin Zabih, a Cornell professor who had been a long-time champion, joined as the faculty director. Under the new governance structure, arXiv’s migration to the cloud and a refactoring of the code base to Python finally took off.</p><p>One Saturday morning,I met Ginsparg at his home. He was carefully inspecting his son’s bike, which I was borrowing for a three-hour ride we had planned to Mount Pleasant. As Ginsparg shared the route with me, he teasingly—but persistently—expressed doubts about my ability to keep up. I was tempted to mention that, in high school, I’d cycled solo across Japan, but I refrained and silently savored the moment when, on the final uphill later that day, he said, “I might’ve oversold this to you.”</p><p>Over the months I spoke with Ginsparg, my main challenge was interrupting him, as a simple question would often launch him into an extended monolog. It was only near the end of the bike ride that I managed to tell him how I found him tenacious and stubborn, and that if someone more meek had been in charge, arXiv might not have survived. I was startled by his response.</p><p>“You know, one person’s tenacity is another person’s terrorism,” he said.</p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p><p>“I’ve heard that the staff occasionally felt terrorized,” he said.</p><p>“By you?” I replied, though a more truthful response would’ve been “No shit.” Ginsparg apparently didn’t hear the question and started talking about something else.</p><p>Beyond the drama—if not terrorism—of its day-to-day operations, arXiv still faces many challenges. The linguist Emily Bender has accused it of being a “cancer” for the way it promotes “junk science” and “fast scholarship.” Sometimes it does seem too fast: In 2023, a much-hyped paper claiming to have cracked room-temperature superconductivity turned out to be thoroughly wrong. (But equally fast was exactly that debunking—proof of arXiv working as intended.) Then there are opposite cases, where arXiv “censors”—so say critics—perfectly good findings, such as when physicist Jorge Hirsch, of h-index fame, had his paper withdrawn for “inflammatory content” and “unprofessional language.”</p><p>How does Ginsparg feel about all this? Well, he’s not the type to wax poetic about having a mission, promoting an ideology, or being a pioneer of “open science.” He cares about those things, I think, but he’s reluctant to frame his work in grandiose ways.</p><p>At one point, I asked if he everreallywants to be liberated from arXiv. “You know, I have to be completely honest—there are various aspects of this that remain incredibly entertaining,” Ginsparg said. “I have the perfect platform for testing ideas and playing with them.” Though he no longer tinkers with the production code that runs arXiv, he is still hard at work on his holy grail for filtering out bogus submissions. It’s a project that keeps him involved, keeps him active. Perhaps, with newer language models, he’ll figure it out. “It’s like that Al Pacino quote: They keep bringing me back,” he said. A familiar smile spread across Ginsparg’s face. “But Al Pacino also developed a real taste for killing people.”</p><p>Let us know what you think about this article.

        <p>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.</p><p>Vivaldi Technologies has announced a new partnership with Proton AG that will integrate the free version of Proton VPN into Vivaldi's web browser, allowing every user a quick and easy way to access avirtual private network (VPN).</p><p>A VPN protects users’ privacy by hiding their real IP address. It acts like a protective tunnel, allowing users to pass through a public network without anyone being able to snoop on their data, whether that's a scammer at the coffee shop or a data-gatheringbehemoth like Google.</p><p>Vivaldi and Proton VPN have positioned the partnership as a “challenge to the dominance of US Big Tech giants,” according to the press release. Vivaldi CEO Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner has long been acritic of the surveillance capitalism model, as farback as his previous browser company, Opera. David Peterson, general manager of Proton VPN, goes further, saying, “Together, Proton VPN and Vivaldi are setting a new standard that challenges the dominance of tech giants, providing a viable European alternative that helps people retake control of their digital lives.” Vivaldi is a Norwegian company, and Proton is based in Switzerland.</p><p>Vivaldi, which I've previously calledthe web's best browser, is already full of privacy features you won't find elsewhere, like an integrated ad blocker, which isn't as robust as what you'll get from add-ons likeuBlock, but is nevertheless sufficient for most users, and most importantly, right there in the browser. It also offers integrations with privacy-friendlier search engines like Brave and StartPage (though neither is the default). Vivaldi also has a full email client, calendar, and RSS reader. The new Proton VPN integration fits well with Vivaldi's all-in-one philosophy. Like the other features, if you aren't interested, the new Proton VPN integration stays out of the way.</p><p>Proton VPN has long topped ourBest VPNs guidefor its robust security, along with an excellent privacy record and no-logs policy. Proton VPN has beenindependently auditedand maintains awarrant canary page. It has long had the bestfreeVPN offering, which is what's being integrated into Vivaldi. Unlike most services, Proton VPN's free version gives full access to all the regular plan's features. The limitations are that it's only for a single device and only three server locations: Japan, the Netherlands, and the US.</p><p>Vivaldi tells WIRED that the Proton VPN integration may come to the mobile versions of the browser at some point, but for now, it's only available in Vivaldi’s desktop browser. Access is through your Vivaldi account—just log in and you'll see an option to use Proton VPN's free VPN as well as a way to upgrade to a paid version.</p>
